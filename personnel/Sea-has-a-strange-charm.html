                                            <p>It cannot be denied that the postmodern era, with its rejection of meta-narratives, marked a serious crisis in all schools of depth psychology. However, it also provided us with a unique opportunity to begin rethinking and renewing ways of theorizing and practicing. Theories are not set in stone, so according to Jung's famous saying, “the psychic is as weakly grasped in theory as the world in general. Theories are not objects of faith, they are either tools of knowledge and therapy, or they are not useful at all” (1954, p. 198). If we want to go beyond the limits set by Freud and Jung, we must accept that our theories do not and can never represent absolute truths, but are only heuristic devices that allow us to map our routes in the meanderings of the unconscious. As Warren Coleman writes, “they are like metaphorical maps of the ever-changing territory of the psyche, subject to the idiosyncratic, personally conditioned descriptions of the cartographers, and only roughly corresponding to the particular psychic territory that the analyst has to encounter” (2009, p. 200). Over the years, there have been many changes - a "strange sea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;charms" in the theoretical constructs and in the clinical practice of both psychoanalysis and analytical psychology, changes that are too often rejected in favor of a dogmatic adherence to the "scraps" of our founding fathers. However, as Giuseppe Civitarese writes in a 2011 article on paradigmatic shifts in psychoanalysis, analysts are now beginning to speak with which the analyst must meet" (2009, p. 200). Over the years, there have been many changes - a "strange sea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;charms" in the theoretical constructs and in the clinical practice of both psychoanalysis and analytical psychology, changes that are too often rejected in favor of a dogmatic adherence to the "scraps" of our founding fathers. However, as Giuseppe Civitarese writes in a 2011 article on paradigmatic shifts in psychoanalysis, analysts are now beginning to speak with which the analyst must meet" (2009, p. 200).

However, as Giuseppe Civitarese writes in a 2011 article on paradigmatic shifts in psychoanalysis, analysts are now beginning to speak&nbsp;<em>in a completely different language compared to Freud's original metatheory. While theoretically they persist, they actually break down into a kaleidoscope of new concepts that require the constant adoption of new perspectives. Moreover, due to the subtle interplay of cross-references, identifications, and differentiations in which they exist, and their deliberately unsaturated nature, they require the analyst to constantly practice doubting and criticizing any form of dogmatism of certain schools. (2011, p. 279)</em></p>
                                            <p>However, based on the works of Fordham and the development school, as I have already noted in the previous work,</p>
                                            <p><em>Many Jungians now have integrated models of practice and training, with a much greater emphasis on boundaries, frameworks, and work in and with the transference, likewise, with an emphasis on object relations and the relational model increasingly modifying our theory and practice. (Connolly, 2015</em> , <em>&nbsp;p. 186-187)</em></p>
                                            <p>Today, however, we are at potential risk of losing the specificity of the Jungian method, with its constant emphasis on the importance of images and the use of allegories and metaphors to clarify clinical material. As Richard Carvajlo emphasizes, fantasy is a function of creating an image, "the purpose of which is the realization of what we call "mind", when it, as it were, becomes visible to itself through analogy, and opens up the possibility of symbolic manipulation for the subject and research" (Carvahlo, 1991, pp. 331-332).</p>
                                            <p>If the psychodynamic approach is to survive, it becomes important to open itself to theoretical and clinical cross-fertilization between different psychoanalytic schools, as well as between depth psychology and other related disciplines. More importantly, we must be prepared to accept the challenge of interacting with other cultures that may have a very different approach to the psyche. According to anthropologist Clifford Hertz,</p>
                                            <p><em>It is the asymmetry [...] between what we believe or feel and what others do that allows us to determine where we are now in the world, how we feel where we are, and where we want or do not want to go. . To hide these gaps and these asymmetries, relegating them to the realm of supplanting or ignoring differences [...] is to cut us off from such knowledge and opportunities: opportunities to quite literally and quite thoroughly change our minds. (1986, p. 114)</em></p>
                                            <p>In this text, I will consider two such shifts, which have been proven by the reevaluation of image and aesthetics in philosophy, in cognitive linguistics, and cognitive aesthetics. The first is the iconic turn or return of the image in psychoanalysis. The second is the return of interest in aesthetics in analytical psychology. At the outset, however, it is necessary to define what we really mean when we talk about images. So, I will begin with a brief overview of the history and phenomenology of the image.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Image definition</em></h4>
                                            <p>As Paul Kugler notes, “in the history of Western thought, the mental tendency to construct images has been depicted primarily in two different forms: a) as a reproductive process depicting some more primary reality; b) as a productive process that creates original entities" (2005, p. 3). However, until recently, image, art and aesthetics were considered secondary ways of accessing reality and creating knowledge and new meanings. As Mark Johnson notes in The&nbsp; <em><strong>Meaning of the Body</strong></em> ,</p>
                                            <p><em>Since the beginning of Western philosophy, art has never been taken seriously as an important way of human interaction and understanding of the world. The Platonic idea that art is mimesis, a form of imitation of the real, made its status derivative and dependent, a secondary source of images and understanding, by no means a direct representation of reality. (2007, p. 210)</em></p>
                                            <p>Since Plato, Western civilization has been marked by constant oscillations between iconoclastic moments of suspicion and distrust of the illusory and imperfect nature of images and moments of deep iconocracy that emphasized the power of images as a means of access to the invisible or transcendent. According to art historian Barbara Maria Stafford, “from an iconoclastic perspective, an earthly or natural image creates a temporary resemblance to a hidden mystery that cannot otherwise be seen. Thus, all figures generating similitude are embodiments. They materialize to demonstrate and spread a mystery that escapes words” (2001, p. 24).</p>
                                            <p>However, since the eighteenth century, with the further declassification of aesthetic experience and sensory perception as subjective and inferior categories of knowledge, the ability of the image to create new meanings was increasingly denied. Today we are constantly bombarded with images, but they are only empty simulacra, dead images that reflect nothing but ourselves and are incapable of any productive capacity (Baudrillard, 1994, pp. 6-7). However, all images, regardless of whether they are considered copies of existing reality, reproductions of a more primary reality, or productive creations of something as yet unknown, have a common denominator: they are related to acts of representation. As Ello Franzoni, an Italian professor of aesthetics, notes,</p>
                                            <p><em>The ambiguous understanding of the term "image" is actually evidenced by the past and present history of the philosophy of artistic experience and theories, which, nevertheless, reveal a common denominator: the image is always associated with "representational" acts, and when it is not itself a "representation" , mediation itself makes this possible. (2001, p. 1)</em></p>
                                            <p>While for Freud the image is only a sign (a representation of something known, even if it is repressed), for Jung the image is primarily a symbol, a means or mediating process through which it becomes possible to imagine and access something unseen and unknown.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Freud, Jung and the image</em></h4>
                                            <p>Freud, while demonstrating his commitment to science and rationality throughout his life, was deeply ambivalent about the value of the image. Nowhere is this more evident than in his theory of dreams. Dream elements are created by transforming thoughts and words into visual images, and thus represent a movement from more advanced ways of thinking to the more regressive and archaic figurative language of childhood and primitive man. As he writes in "Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis," dreams are "relegated to those states of intellectual development that have long since been supplanted - to the language of images, to symbolic connections, perhaps to conditions that existed before our thinking developed. language" (1916, p. 199). In addition, Freud shows a marked distrust of the authenticity of dream images, which he considers to be false and inherently suspicious:</p>
                                            <p><em>The concept of the elements of a dream suggests that it is an unnatural phenomenon, a substitute for something else that is unknown to the dreamer (such as a goal in wrong actions), a substitute for knowledge that exists in the dream, but is inaccessible to it. (1916, p. 113)</em></p>
                                            <p>As Christopher Bollas points out, "this makes him regard the text of the dream as a pernicious and deceptive representation" (1987, p. 68). For Freud, dream images are purely reproductive and therefore incapable of producing new meanings. The task of the analyst, therefore, is only to transform the image back into words in order to make the meaning of the dream intelligible. As Donald Meltzer put it, "Freud sees the problem of understanding symbols as a task of re-translation, instead, the formation of symbols looks like a process of translation, change of form, without transformation or amplification of meaning" (1983, p. 20). Freud focused all his attention precisely on the text of dreams. He did this, as Bollas notes, "specifically in order to identify the dream-thoughts that stimulated the dream in order to then translate the image back into words" (Bollas, 1987, p. 69). He ignored the importance of sleep as an experience with its own special qualities; as an experience which, according to Bollas, brings us into contact with our own internal and highly idiomatic aesthetics, an aesthetics distinguished by the Ego-style inherent in each of us" (ibid., p. 81).</p>
                                            <p>In contrast to Freud's mistrust of images, for Jung the visual image always takes precedence over the word. As George Hogenson notes, "Even the casual reader is struck by Jung's fascination with figurative representations, works of art, primarily pictorial [...] for Jung, the visual image is as important as language for Freud" (2009, p. 333). Jung made a clear distinction between signs and symbols, and believed that dream images are symbolic insofar as they "constitute an attempt to illuminate, by analogy, that which still belongs entirely to the realm of the unknown, or that which is yet to be" (1953, p. . 494). Thus, images generate new meanings; they cannot be translated, but only amplified by analogy, seeking to clarify some of their possible meanings. Despite this position, Jung's need to find a scientific basis for his theory about the collective unconscious and archetypes forced him to neglect the role of aesthetics in the creation of images and in their psychological function. As Paul Bishop says, referring to alchemical symbols, "emphasizing the importance of intuition (<em>opinion</em>) Jung recognized the aesthetic appeal of such symbols, although he was reluctant to go a step further, and saw this appeal as central to their psychological functioning” (2009, p. 87). Therefore, symbolic images work through processes of analogy. According to Stafford, analogy is “a vision of orderly relations formulated as similarity in difference. This orderliness is neither easily verified nor acquired at the expense of diversity” (2001, p. 9). The difficulty in analogy, then, lies in finding sufficient similarity to warrant giving a common name to various objects while recognizing their significant differences. Analogy should not be confused with establishing identity or isomorphism. However, this is exactly what Jung did, combining images from very different cultural and historical contexts, as I have already shown in a previous work on Jung's approach to alchemical images (Connolly, 2013). Combining images in this way led Jung to believe that, although the content of images varies, the basic form can be reduced to a limited number of universal and eternal patterns. As the Italian philosopher and Jungian analyst Mario Trevi writes, "Jung's mistake was to assume a hypothesis about a repeatable, and in any case capable of improvement, fixity in such a rich world of forms, where probable similarities are based not on implausible a priori structures, but on universal human relative constancy of human needs" (1993, p. 62). If the basic form of images is somehow innate and immutable, aesthetics would have nothing to say about the creation and function of images. Jung was always inclined to contrast aesthetic expression with understanding itself,</p>
                                            <p>Another undesired result of this is that images are seen as somewhat secondary to the archetype. Contrary to this , Warren Coleman, in his recent book <em>Art and the Image</em> &nbsp;, insists on the primacy of the image:</p>
                                            <p><em>I argue that any form or structure is secondary in the process of creating archetypal images through the activity of the symbolic imagination. That is, symbolic imagination is formed not on the basis of already existing mental forms, but primarily as a means by which such forms can be initiated. Ontologically, the image is primary, so abstract forms represent further levels of symbolic thought, and are more likely to be established by symbolic imagination than to establish it.

                                            <p>A further complication becomes apparent in the fact that Jung conceived of the image as something purely internal, entirely generated from the unconscious. Jung writes: “Consciousness has no direct relation to any material objects. We perceive nothing but images transmitted to us indirectly through a complex nervous apparatus” (1933, p. 745). The result of this worldview was that Jung failed to adequately consider the role of the body and the wider material environment in the creation of meaningful images. Philosophers such as Merleau-Ponty object to this careless attitude:</p>
                                            <p><em>The body is our immediate habitat in the world. Sometimes it is limited to actions necessary for the preservation of life and, accordingly, places the biological world around us; at other times, by developing these primary actions and moving from literal to figurative meaning, it discovers through it the essence of a new meaning: this applies to motor skills such as dance. Sometimes, finally, the meaning sought cannot be achieved by natural bodily means; then the body is forced to create an instrument for itself, and thus it projects a cultural world around itself. (1962, p. 146)</em></p>
                                            <p>Similarly, Stafford (2007) emphasizes that image comes into play at the interface between mind and body, and between body and world:</p>
                                            <p><em>Instead of perceiving images as a simple illustration of some modular function, we need to better understand the range and variety of cognitive&nbsp; </em><em><strong>work</strong></em><em> they </em><em>&nbsp;perform. Avoiding both Plato's claim that they are necessarily sensuous copies of paradigmatic ideas, and more recent phenomenological claims that images are entirely generated by the brain's own activity, I interpret them as a boundary event [...] an environment or interface where the world and sub objects are jointly built and ecologically represent each other. (p. 212)</em></p>
                                            <p>Today, thanks to the cross-fertilization between different analytic schools and different cultures, we are able to begin to critique the theories of our illustrious predecessors and use imagery and aesthetics to expand our theories in exciting new ways.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Iconic revolution or the return of the image in psychoanalysis</em></h4>
                                            <p>The recent encounter between psychoanalysis and Asian culture has led to a reassessment of the importance of the image in the dream experience and in the analyst's approaches to image interpretation. Christopher Bollas, in his recent publication, <em>China on the Mind</em> , outlines some of the possible consequences for the Freudian model of psyche and therapy as a result of contact with Asian culture. Bollas distinguishes between two different states of consciousness: one dominated by a parental order that is causal, metonymic, diachronic, representational (one that favors content over form), dependent on words, and one dominated by a maternal order, which is metaphorical, synchronic, presentational (one that favors form over content), and depends on imagery. Bollas argues that the maternal order</p>
                                            <p><em>has been systematically repressed within the psychoanalytic movement, but since this is an Eastern way of being and relating, is it possible that the growing trade between West and East is de-repressing the maternal order and challenging the hermeneutically bound causal paternal focus that has dominated in psychoanalytic discourse? (2013, p. 29)</em></p>
                                            <p>Similarly, the English analyst Kenneth Wright suggests that Freud's approach to the unconscious is based on a paternalistic mode in which the unconscious self is perceived “as a subject to be conquered rather than a being to be brought into life” (2015, p. 950 ). For Freud, the interpretation of dreams is a matter of translating visual images - "presentations of objects" - into words. Philosopher Suzanne Langer (1947) distinguishes between discursive symbols and non-discursive or presentational symbols. The discursive symbols of common language and systems such as mathematics and physics are arbitrary and generally accepted signs whose meaning is unambiguous and which are bound by the rules of the system in which they took form. Whereas the representational symbols found in dreams, myths, music, poetry, and art contain many levels of uncertain meaning. According to Langer,</p>
                                            <p><em>the word "sensation" must be taken here in its broadest sense, meaning everything that can be felt, from physical sensations, pain and comfort, excitement and peace, to the most complex emotions, intellectual tension, or the persistent sensuous tones of conscious human life. (Langer, 1947, p. 15)</em></p>
                                            <p>Helping patients understand and integrate these varieties of symbols requires the careful use of analogy and metaphor to begin to explore possible meanings. As Coleman says, “no single interpretation can ever capture all meanings, and no matter how interpretations are made, their meanings can never be exhausted” (2016, p. 93). Premature or insensitive interpretations can impair the patient's experience of the dream, and the potential real harm is evident when the patient is unable to represent his own subjective affective experiences due to failed early maternal mirroring and attunement. As Wright points out,</p>
                                            <p><em>If the words remain unrepresented, as might happen to a patient who lacks the ability to represent his experience through figurative mother forms – in other words, when the experience is unrepresented – the situation is ominous. In fact, the other pre-directed and named his experience even before birth, denying him the opportunity to become himself. (2015, p. 947)</em></p>
                                            <p>It is here that we can learn something from the Eastern system. Kawai (1976) suggests that in Japan the line between conscious and unconscious is much more blurred than in Western individuals, and that while the Ego complex is the center of consciousness in the West, in the East this place is occupied by the Self. This means that approaching the unconscious requires not so much a direct line of attack with words and linear thinking, as establishing connections with oneself through images, which is achieved mostly in roundabout ways. In the Eastern approach to the unconscious, as the Japanese Jungian analyst Megumi Yama writes, it is necessary to "allow the images to begin to emerge, express and unfold on their own, and refrain from strenuous verbal articulations until the invisible is ready to be visible" (2013, p. 69).</p>
                                            <p>Italian psychoanalysis in recent years has been characterized by a new openness to the possibility of integrating certain key Jungian concepts. This allowed non-Jungian analysts to begin rethinking the traditional Freudian approach to dream imagery. Domenico Chianese and Andreana Fontana, in their 2010 book <em>Immaginando&nbsp;</em> , argue for the need for an "iconic turn" in psychoanalysis capable of integrating the image into Freudian theory and practice. They suggest that such a turn can go beyond the semantic approach to the generation of meanings:</p>
                                            <p><em>From our side, it is not about some careless desire to reject the tradition to which we feel our belonging, but more about its reinterpretation. For us as analysts, words and thoughts are central, but we believe that language and thought have their primordial foundations in perceptual experience, as that implicit horizon of the world of the senses, of aesthetics, of the worlds that feed language and thought, and that language and thought represent the inexhaustible experience of these worlds. (2010, p. 164)</em></p>
                                            <p>Although Chianese and Fontana's aim is not to assert the primacy of the image over the word, they recognize the long-standing psychoanalytic flaw of simplifying the image to the word and treating images as something secondary to the word. As they claim,</p>
                                            <p><em>Insults are simply non-words; they are not structured semantically or syntactically like language, they bring to light worlds that are different from those that emerge from words. The logic of the image cannot be reduced to predicative and conceptual logic. (ibid., p. 147)</em></p>
                                            <p>The authors trace the history of the gradual re-emergence of the image in the analysis, starting with some passages from Freud himself, who in Chapter 29 of the New Introductory Lectures of 1933 states that “the primary basis of the dream is not so much the fulfillment of a wish, even if this remains the goal of the dream and determines it content, as much as the hallucinatory activity itself, the need for representation" (cited by Botella and Botella, 2005, p. 42). The approach proposed by Cianese and Fontana is a direct consequence of the elaboration of Bion's ideas by the Milan school of psychoanalysis, particularly the work of Antonino Ferro. Cianese and Fontana are also clear about the need to open a dialogue with Jung (he is cited three times in their work). Nevertheless, the authors acknowledge their fundamental indebtedness to the Italian analytical psychologist and sand therapist Paolo Aite. As when they write:<em>Paessaggi della&nbsp; </em><em>psyche </em><em>“</em> , in which Aite describes his long experience as an analyst, there is a desire to restart the dialogue between Jung and Freud, which was so abruptly interrupted back in 1913” (2010, p. 190). The result of this approach is a new emphasis on dreaming as a visual, aesthetic experience that cannot simply be translated into words without betraying the dream experience and its meaning. As they put it,</p>
                                            <p><em>The meaning we attribute to the dream (which remains&nbsp;</em> a " <em>visual experience</em> " <em>,&nbsp;</em> an " <em>aesthetic experience</em> " <em>, which can only be partially reduced to discourse), the significance we give to the unconscious (thoughts about which are only reductive by the categories of language, since it has an essential and fundamental connection with visual experience), the significance we give it in psychotherapy, where we have to think not only, and not so much in terms of words, but rather in terms of images. (2010, p. 147)</em></p>
                                            <p>Chianese and Fontana thus advocate not only a return to the image, but more importantly, the need for an aesthetic stance in our approach to dreaming. Paradoxically, this is exactly what has been ignored by analytical psychology for so long, because despite the work of Gillman and the archetypal school, very few of us consider the aesthetic quality of dream metaphors and our own interpretations.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Aesthetic turn in analytical psychology</em></h4>
                                            <p>We have seen that Jung's tendency to oppose sensory perception and rational linear thinking, on the one hand, and purely subjective imaginative fantasy thinking, on the other, led him to deny that aesthetics is involved in meaning-making and cognitive processes. One result of this is that, as John Beebe points out, “aesthetics remains somewhat outside our psychology in theory and is rarely seen as ancillary to what we do in practice with patients” (2010, p. 170). However, in recent years it has become increasingly apparent that metaphorical imagery is rooted in the body and the world at large, and that it serves important cognitive functions. As the works of such authors as Lakoff and Johnson have shown, even the most abstract forms of thought are inherently metaphorical: "most conceptual structures of natural language are metaphorical in nature. Conceptual structure is based on physical and cultural experience” (1980/2003, p. 107). On this basis, Mark Johnson argues that we must consider the aesthetic as fundamental to understanding the human experience of being and meaning-making. According to him, "aesthetics refers to everything that is included in meaning - form, expression, connections, qualities, emotions, feelings, values, purpose, etc." (2007, p. 212).</p>
                                            <p>John Beebe, perhaps because of his lifelong interaction with cinema, believes that the aesthetic stance is an important therapeutic tool and that the aesthetic attitude "confronts both the analyst and the patient with the problem of taste, affects how it is shaped and 'framed' psychotherapy, and can lend a dimension of appeal to the analyst's reflection of the struggle that drives the patient's efforts to be a more calmly functioning person" (2010, p. 165). Beebe outlines three specific aesthetic dimensions that he believes have been too often neglected in psychotherapy: taste, form, and attractiveness. Similarly, Mark Winborn believes that “many of the experiences associated with the analytic process—for example, the experience of depth, emergence of meaning, transcendence, deep connection, an exciting plot flow or moments of a real encounter - can be viewed through the prism of aesthetic experience" (2015, p. 94). In particular, Winborn focuses on three different aesthetic experiences: the aesthetics of the setting; aesthetics of interpretation; and narrative aesthetics. Both Beebe and Winborn argue that the analyst must develop an aesthetic stance, and that this is essential for us to consider and develop the aesthetics of the analytic process. What I want to explore is, on the one hand, what we as analysts need to do to develop an aesthetic stance, and on the other hand, the role of this aesthetic stance in developing our metaphorical capacity—a capacity that will help us to improve the quality our own processes of imagery and reverie,</p>
                                            <h4><em>Development of an aesthetic position</em></h4>
                                            <p>Paul Bishop argues that Goethe's approach to aesthetics can give us a new awareness of the significance of archetypal experiences: "What Jung called 'archetypal experience' can be better understood when it is freed from the delusion of mystical connotations and understood in Goethe's logic as a category of the aesthetic" ( 2009, p. 75). In a 1789 essay on the qualities characterizing good art, Goethe outlines three different approaches to artistic creation that distinguish the average artist from the successful artist: simple imitation, manner, and style (1789/1986, p. 72). If simple imitation requires only meticulous attention to detail to obtain a copy of the original, manner instead tries to find a pictorial language capable of expressing the spirit of the artist directly and characteristically, but it is style that “rests on the most fundamental principle of knowledge, on the essence of things – so much so that as much as we are given to perceive this essence in a visible and tangible form" (ibid., p. 71-72). Therefore, good art requires that the artist's work "have such a content and such a form that it appears natural and at the same time seems higher than nature" (ibid., p. 81).</p>
                                            <p>I would like to suggest that these considerations of Goethe's about aesthetics can give us important insights into how analysts can form an aesthetic position. I think it is fair to assume that most analysts begin, consciously or unconsciously, to imitate their own analyst in his/her setting, relational style, and methods of interpretation – just as they tend to adhere as closely as possible to the theoretical framework and rules of practice learned during training. As Bion once remarked, “it is impossible to undergo analysis without learning the psychoanalysis practiced by a particular psychoanalyst; and this is more of a misfortune than an advantage” (1984, p. 27). Gradually, however, through experience in clinical practice, the analyst begins to develop her own theories that are more in line with the clinical facts as she encounters them directly, theories that more consonant with her own "personal comparison". This will often contrast (or perhaps even conflict) with the theory it formally adheres to, since, as Fonagy noted in a 2002 panel discussion on Method Differences, “theory is largely irrelevant to clinical practice, and there is a gap between public theories and the more private implicit or unconscious theories that actually guide individual practice” (2002, p. 453). Warren Coleman seems to be describing something very similar when he writes: and there is a gap between public theories and the more private implicit or unconscious theories that actually guide individual practice” (2002, p. 453). Warren Coleman seems to be describing something very similar when he writes: and there is a gap between public theories and the more private implicit or unconscious theories that actually guide individual practice” (2002, p. 453). Warren Coleman seems to be describing something very similar when he writes:</p>
                                            <p><em>There is a transformation of general aspects related to all theories ("universals") through familiarization with the details that make up such theories. The more one becomes able to recognize theory in practice, the less relevant theory becomes, as universal generalities are replaced by long sequences of unique details organized into patterns that become better and better understood. (2013, p. 202)</em></p>
                                            <p>Only when the analyst is able to perceive the essence of things and convey them in a "visible and tangible form" can she be said to be a truly successful analyst. Coleman compares this to the intangible quality that makes an artistic performance emotionally moving or spiritually inspiring, and as he points out, this is not simply a matter of clinical experience or practice, as it requires “a spark that comes from the inner depths of the artist or the analyst, their of one's own essence, from oneself" (ibid., p. 203). As Bion points out, “only after you qualify [as an analyst] do you have a chance to become an analyst. The analyst you become is you, and you alone” (1987, p. 15).</p>
                                            <h4><em>Aesthetics metaphors</em></h4>
                                            <p>If most metaphors are universal in the sense that they form part of the same linguistic and conceptual context in which a person is born and grows, then the analysis is about the ability to respond to the patient's material using precisely original and appropriate metaphors. A fundamental characteristic of any original or poetic metaphor is its ability to pile up and combine imagination and feeling, cognition and sensation to create new meaning. According to Hester in " <em>The Meaning of Poetic Metaphor",</em> &nbsp;the ability to create a good metaphor essentially depends on the ability to "see" when this process is defined as "an intuitive experience - an action, with the help of which one can choose among the surrounding - sensory (quasi-sensory) mass images [...] corresponding aspects of such images" (1967, p. 213).</p>
                                            <p>Jung always made a clear distinction between symbol (pointing to something unknown that cannot be formulated conceptually) and sign (pointing to something known). However, it is much less clear in defining the status of a metaphor. Smythe and Baydala (2012) point out that symbols can have a denotative function that describes or defines something literal and relatively self-important, but their expressive function, metaphorical and with an open plot, is relevant. According to them, the expressive metaphorical function of the symbol cannot be understood conceptually and cannot be evaluated for truth. However, it can be judged aesthetically or morally in terms of what Goodman calls “by right of giving” – its ability to resonate with and illuminate the personal or cultural context from which it emerged (2012, pp. 66-70).</p>
                                            <p>This creative act of “as if seeing”, essential to the creation of original dream metaphors, can, however, fail for three different reasons: the created metaphor is part of a conceptual system of generally accepted metaphors and does not add anything new; there is not enough similarity between the two images of the metaphor to justify using them to describe a relationship; or there is a refusal to accept the difference between images when they are too similar. If there is not enough similarity between the two images of the metaphor to justify their use in describing a relationship, then what we have is a kind of pseudo-metaphor. It is essentially a defensive position, as it is created precisely to isolate the affects, either because they are too charged to be contained, or because there is insufficient inner space for containment. On the other hand, if there is a failure to accept the difference and there is too much similarity between the images, then we are left with specific metaphors which are purely symbolic and which demonstrate the lack of difference between the thing as such and its mental representation - this is what we usually encounter in dreams related to with trauma and psychosis. It is here that the analyst's metaphorical ability can help her realize that the patient's ability to use metaphor to represent the inner world is absent or insufficient. Attributing symbolic meaning to pseudo-metaphors or concrete metaphors (and in this context it does not matter whether the meaning is interpreted in terms of archetypes or in terms of transference and countertransference) is at best useless and at worst even harmful.

                                            <p>All this suggests that when we consider dreams, it is not enough to take into account the conceptual articulation of the meaning of the dream content; we must also be able to appreciate the aesthetic value of dream metaphors: their originality; the power of their expressive ability to give form to raw experiences; and their ability to connect different experiences to sustain the creative tension between thought and feeling, feeling and intuition. This allows you to add something new both in a personal and collective context. Similarly, when we interpret or amplify such images, what is important is not the correctness of our judgments, but their metaphorical power, their expressive ability to facilitate the emergence of new processes in the development of images. When a metaphor becomes capable of holding this creative tension, it becomes truly symbolic to the extent that</p>
                                            <h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>
                                            <p>When the dialogue between Freud and Jung broke off so abruptly in 1913, for a long time it created an obstacle to any possibility of cross-fertilization between the two schools of depth psychology. On the one hand, there was Freud with his model of the mind-psyche enclosed within the individual body, a method based on the paternal principle, emphasizing the causal, diachronic, representational, and linguistic. On the other side was Jung, with his model of the radically interconnected mind and his mother's method of therapy, which focused primarily on the metaphorical, presentational, synchronic, and figurative. However, both men sought in any way to ground their psychology in the spirit of science of their time, and given the status of aesthetics as an inferior form of knowledge, neither of them took it into account. The result was that that both privileged content over form. Today, the reappraisal of aesthetics as a means of investigating the meaning-making process offers both psychoanalysis and analytical psychology a unique opportunity to renew this dialogue between our two different schools.</p>
