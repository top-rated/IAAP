                                            <p>So far, I have described, based on studies of infants, some important features of the innate giftedness of the newborn. We saw that the child we are observing already has the ability to perceive the limits of his own body from birth; thus, she can distinguish herself from her mother. Of course, all this is still beyond reflexive awareness. But the newborn has amazing possibilities of perception and reaction. In addition, specific human motivational systems and basic affects are already at work and can be observed in various activities of infants. It can be assumed that they also express various rudimentary experiences. In other words, there is already an important archetypal legacy; but in order to be fully manifested, it needs the input of the parent object.</p>
                                            <p>Lichtenberg talks about a “basic plan” for the infant-environment system that wants to be implemented step by step. But he immediately adds, “This basic plan is the same for all infant-environment systems; but the ways of embodiment are completely individual" (Lichtenberg, oral communication). Translated into Jungian language, one could speak of a fundamental, archetypal reality that is always modified by personal interests and needs. The opposite is true; that is, the archetypal dimension affects the personal dimension as well. Disorders occur when there is too great a gap between the personal and the archetypal.</p>
                                            <p>From a Jungian perspective, the early processes of maturation and development are organized and directed by the self, which is the guiding center of the entire personality. There is also a strong emphasis on the term "self" in infant studies; however, we must differentiate what is understood in different schools by the concept of Self.</p>
                                            <p>Thus, for Lichtenberg, self can be defined as a sense of unity that remains stable despite the changes in emotional states that accompany human experience (Lichtenberg, 1992, p. 57). In other words, the self, as Lichtenberg sees it, is integrally related to a sense of identity and continuity in time. Lichtenberg also noted that each of the different motivational systems has its own special organization. However, at any point in time, the hierarchy or priority in different systems changes. For example, when physiological regulation is needed, we may experience dominant needs such as hunger or thirst or physical fatigue. Or, in situations where the self-affirmation system is at the center of attention, mental concentration may come to the fore.</p>
                                            <p>Needs that are central to one system may also shift or flow smoothly into other systems. But they can also come into conflict with each other. For example, sexual arousal can intersect with aggressive motivation, which then manifests as fear, disgust, etc. Clearly, there is a higher superordinate organization responsible for compensation and regulation between motivational systems; and the center of this organization, Lichtenberg defines as self, or self-organization. He also defines the self "as an independent center for the initiation, organization, and integration of experience and motivation" (Lichtenberg, 1992, p. 58). The maturation and development of this integrative and organizational potential is of most interest to infant researchers. It is this ability that is specific to the human species, and at the same time very vulnerable. All psychological, and probably</p>
                                            <p>In any case, the interest of infant researchers in the emergence and development of the self may be of deep interest to Jungian analysts, even though the concepts of self are not completely identical.</p>
                                            <h4><strong>Development of organizational forms of sense of self</strong></h4>
                                            <p>Daniel Stern proposed an experience-based model for understanding the development of a sense of self. His model, derived from studies of infants, envisions the development of a sense of self through stages from birth to eighteen months. From the very beginning, an integral feature of any sense of self is the understanding that for this (sense of self) another person is needed (most often, at least, mother). There is always a feeling of "self with another".</p>
                                            <p>This model of infant development differs from other, popular psychoanalytic views, which are mainly based on the findings of Margaret Mahler (Mahler et al., 1975). According to Mahler, after a brief phase of autism, the infant goes through a stage of symbiotic fusion with another (between the second and seventh months), after which it begins to differentiate gradually as a separate person. Unlike Mahler, Stern and other researchers have observed that infants are able to distinguish between themselves and other people at birth. I want to summarize Daniel Stern's most important conceptualizations.</p>
                                            <h4><strong>Emerging, emergent self</strong></h4>
                                            <p>From birth to the second month, the baby lives in a world that Stern calls the sphere of the emergent self <em>.</em>. At this preliminary stage, certain events and impressions are experienced as having their own existence. A newborn perceives them as separate moments without focusing on the relationship between them. . Observing such discrete, unrelated experiences, other psychoanalytic thinkers concluded that infants live in a state of undifferentiation. However, according to Stern, the subjective life of an infant can consist of many expressive and vivid experiences. Of course, we currently have no way of knowing whether the infant feels the connection between these different experiences. He probably still lacks the understanding that any coherence between different experiences could exist at all. But over time, these individual moments begin to organize themselves into successively larger, more versatile structures. The baby experiences that</p>
                                            <p>This global subjective world of emergent organization is and remains the fundamental sphere of human subjectivity. It operates initially without the infant's awareness – as a matrix of experience from which thoughts, perceived forms, identified actions, and verbalized feelings will later emerge. It also acts as a source of constant affective evaluations of events. Finally, it is the main reservoir of all creative experience to dip into.</p>
                                            <p>(Stern, 1985, page 67)</p>
                                            <p>In other words, from a Jungian point of view, it could be said that this is the primary form of what in later life is called the emergence of the contents of the unconscious. Over time, this content can transform one's sense of self and attitude toward the world, and can significantly enrich it. It is the source of any creative activity. In any case, the baby experiences here the earliest prototype of the creative process. And this process is aimed at creating the initial organization of a sense of self.</p>
                                            <h4><strong>"Sense of nuclear self"</strong></h4>
                                            <p>Stern called this first area "sense of a core self" - a sense of nuclear self. He and other researchers noted that by the second month of life, a sense of self had already formed. This enables the infant to experience his intentions and motivations as truly his own. If the baby could speak, it would now say: "I look at the Mother"; or: "I answer her when she looks at me"; or: "Now I'm reaching for her breast (or bottle)." At this point, the infant's sense of the limits of his own body and sense of coherence come to life as well. At the same time, the infant acquires the experience of togetherness in the presence of another, the caregiver. However, this is not an experience of symbiotic fusion. Rather, according to Stern, it is a way of being with a self-regulating other. The infant experiences changes in its own internal state that occur through another, namely the caregiver; for example through feeding, bathing and changing diapers. However, interaction with a self-regulating other is not always pleasant. Aversive motivations and affects may also be activated. In addition, the infant's sense of self depends on the caregiver, as it is related to his need for security; this manifests itself in various behavioral manifestations of attachment, such as mutual gaze, snuggling, and holding. Despite the fact that the infant's sense of self changes due to the activity of the caregiver, the boundary between him (himself) and the other remains unchanged. It can be described as a relation, with a self-regulating other, rather than a fusion. However, it is important to keep in mind that during this phase the infant's experience consists mainly of bodily sensations and various exchanges of physical intimacy. Aversive motivations and affects may also be activated.

                                            <h4>" <strong>Sense of subjective self" - intersubjectivity</strong></h4>
                                            <p>Between the seventh and fifteenth months of life, the capacity for real interpersonal relationships develops. Babies discover that they can share subjective experiences with someone else. If in the previous phase the infant's subjective experience was still determined by the mother's regulation, now the focus shifts to the need for&nbsp; <em>shared</em> &nbsp;experience. There are&nbsp; <em>three types</em> &nbsp;of internal states that are critical to interpersonal relationships, and babies at this age can share before they even have the ability to speak.</p>
                                            <p>First, it is the ability&nbsp; <em>to divide the direction of attention</em> . For example, the mother points to an object. But she can draw the baby's attention to this object only if the baby understands that he needs to shift the focus from the mother's hand and direct his gaze in the direction that her finger is pointing.</p>
                                            <p>By approximately 9 months of age, the baby begins to point to objects independently. Additionally, it can now allow its gaze to wander between the location of the object and the mother's face. He can also notice if the mother herself is just as attentive.</p>
                                            <p>Secondly, the ability&nbsp; <em>to separate intentions</em> . Stern gives the most direct example of intentional communication before the emergence of language as a means of communication. (1985, p. 131). For example, the mother can hold something that the baby wants, maybe a cookie. The baby extends his hand, palm up, to his mother. By making grasping movements and looking back and forth between his hand and his mother's face, the necessary communication occurs. These actions directed toward a referent person mean that the infant attributes an internal mental state to that person; namely, understanding the infant's intention and the ability to satisfy that intention. Intentions become shared experiences. In other words, mutual intentionality becomes a reality, although, of course, the infant does not yet have self-awareness. .</p>
                                            <p>The third and most significant factor for further emotional development is manifested in the emergence at this age of the need&nbsp; <em>to separate affective states</em>. One group of researchers described a phenomenon they called "social referencing." Here is one example of social references that I took from Stern (1985, pp. 220f.). A 1-year-old baby finds himself in a situation that can certainly create uncertainty; typically ambivalence between approach and rejection. A baby can be enticed with an interesting toy to crawl over a "visual chasm" (an imaginary fall that is slightly frightening at the age of 1). When infants encounter this situation and signal uncertainty, they look to their mother to read her face for affective content; essentially to see how they must feel, to get a second opinion to help resolve their uncertainty (to climb over the chasm or not). If the mother was asked to show pleasure on her face, to smile, an infant crosses a visual barrier. If the mother showed a frightened face, the infant turns away from the obstacle, backs away and may become upset. The point is that infants will not regard the mother in this way unless they attribute to her the capacity to have and display affect that is relevant to their own actual or potential state. In this example, we can see how the caregiver affects the infant's sense of self, and his further development of identity.</p>
                                            <p>In addition, something very important for the analysis of adults was investigated. From birth, the mother carries out meaningful exchanges with the baby. She interprets all the infant's behavior in terms of meanings. In other words, she assigns them meaning. At first, she introduces the semantic element herself, as Stern says, and continues to link the infant's behavior through her own framework of meanings created by her. Gradually, as the infant develops, frameworks of meaning begin to be created together. The meanings that the mother creates are not only in her observations but also in her fantasies about what the infant is like; as well as her fantasies about how the baby will develop, what kind of person it will be in the future (Stern, 1985, p. 134). It is obvious that such maternal fantasies influence the behavior of the infant; and will also greatly influence his own fantasies. This relationship between maternal fantasies and observed infant behavior was investigated by Stern (1971). In this way, Jung's opinion becomes clearer: if infants are only a part of their parents' psychology or are merged with it, then, Jung concluded, the mental disorders of infants would be only the mental disorders of their parents.</p>
                                            <p>In this phase, where the infant discovers a subjective sense of self and inner connectedness, and also intersubjectively manifests which aspects of experience can be joined and which cannot. At one end of the hypothetical scale of experience at this stage will be a sense of psychic attachment At the other end is a feeling of deep isolation, even "cosmic loneliness" (Köhler, 1988, p. 61). According to Stern's model, only now is fusion with a significant other possible, while psychoanalytically, the period of symbiosis begins to recede between the ages of 7 and 9 months. The decisive factor at this stage is the so-called "affective congruence"; that is, how much mother and child can adapt to each other's affects. Such co-adjustment ensures the further development of the infant's sense of self and the manifestation of the sphere of intersubjectivity. Sensitive at best, the mother's affirming attitude allows the child to feel, "I know you know how I'm doing" (Köhler, 1988, p. 64). Thus, at this stage of human development, the need to discover oneself, to be seen, heard and understood becomes central for the first time.</p>
                                            <p>(Stern, 1985, p. 272)</p>
                                            <h4><strong>Verbal sense of self</strong></h4>
                                            <p>At the age of 15 to 18 months, a new stage of organization of the child's feelings about himself and his connection with others begins. This leap in development, which coincides with the acquisition of language, can be compared to a revolution. It begins with the emergence of the child's ability to perceive himself as an object of his own reflection. Thus,&nbsp; <em>the objective self</em> &nbsp;emerges next to&nbsp; <em>the subjective self</em> &nbsp;of the previous phases. The tendency of children of this age to look with admiration at their own reflection in the mirror and to recognize themselves is a vivid evidence of this phase; as well as the development of the ability for symbolic play and further differentiation in language learning. Through language, themes of connection, separation and intimacy are experienced with a significant other on a level not previously possible.</p>
                                            <p>But language is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it enriches the field of common experience; on the other hand, limits. Only part of the original experience of experiencing the world can be expressed in words. The rest remains incorrectly named and not sufficiently understood. Many other realms remain similarly unexpressed, remaining unnamed but nonetheless real. Thus, language drives a wedge between two modes of experience: one that can only be lived directly, and another that can be represented verbally. By increasing the amount of experience associated with words, the child is disconnected from the spontaneous flow of experience that characterizes the preverbal state. So the child gains access to his culture at the cost of losing the solidity and integrity of his original experience.</p>
                                            <p>This state of affairs both integrates and fragments experience and introduces the infant into a crisis of self-awareness. The self becomes a mystery. The infant knows that there are levels and layers of self-experience that are to some extent alienated from the formal experience established by language. The previous harmony is destroyed. (Stern, 1985, p. 272)</p>
                                            <p>This crisis of self-awareness arises because, for the first time in his life, the infant experiences himself as divided and rightly feels that no one can heal this split. Sterne says, "The infant has not lost omnipotence, but, on the contrary, has lost the integrity of experience" (p. 273).</p>
                                            <p>Thus, Stern described four organizational stages of the sense of self - emergent (emerging) self, nuclear self, subjective self and verbal self. But he emphasized that these points of crystallization are not strictly limited by age. The various structures that make up a child's sense of self can develop sequentially, each of which has its own period of formation and vulnerability. However, higher degrees do not simply replace previous ones. Once a certain quality in the sense of self has arisen, it remains for life. In other words, there are four basic ways of being in the world. Throughout life, they may develop, differentiate, and renew or enrich, but they may also remain undifferentiated, atrophied, or cleave to some extent.</p>
                                            <p>In order to illustrate these four co-existing spheres, Sterne uses the experience of making love.</p>
                                            <p>Falling in love is an intersubjective event that fascinates us completely. It includes the sense of self and other as separate physical entities, as moving forms. This is an experience in the realm of nuclear relativity, but with a sense of subjectivity, will and active enthusiasm for physical action. [I would add that each partner also influences and activates the other's experience of his own body as a self-regulated other.] At the same time, this includes the experience of feeling the subjective states of the other: the sharing of desire, the alignment of intentions, and the mutual states of synchronous movement of arousal that arise in the field of intersubjective relations. And if one of the lovers says "I love you" for the first time, the words summarize what is happening in other areas (covering the verbal perspective) and perhaps bring a completely new note to the couple's relationship that can change the meaning of the story, which led to these words and will continue after the utterance. This is already an experience in the field of verbal communication. [I would add that lovers tend to create an idiomatic language of interaction that may bear some resemblance to the dialogue between mother and child. This type of language facilitates instinctive emotional exchange, whereas highly abstract language directed only at the head will hinder such exchange.] (Stern, 1985, p. 30)</p>
                                            <p>The emergent self and its area of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;"relationship" is expressed, according to Stern, in the feeling, for example, of losing oneself in the color of another's eyes. It is as if the eyes are not, for a moment, part of the other's being. "At the moment when the color of the eyes again belongs to the known other, there is an experience of emergence, an experience in the realm of "emergent relationality" (ibid., p. 31)</p>
                                            <h4><strong>Origins of human patterns of interaction</strong></h4>
                                            <p>The infant's various experiences of being with a self-regulating other form a specific life episode, which is then retained in memory. Most of the episodes that are shared with the caregiver, such as changing diapers, feeding, various games, are repeated. Therefore, they are recorded in memory and can be internalized in a more general form. There is a kind of knowledge and expectation of how the next episode or event will unfold and what changes in self-experience will occur during it. As a result of many episodes that are recorded in the memory, primary ideas and expectations emerge; what Stern called the abbreviation "RIGs" (Representations of Generalized Interactions), "representations of interactions that have been generalized." These RUVs are not isolated images of mother and father,&nbsp;<em>expectations regarding interactions with significant others</em> . For the child, they form internal knowledge, accumulated through experience, about how the caregiver's activities affect her state, whether through stimulation, pleasure, fear, or pain.</p>
                                            <p>By the term "RUV" Stern calls flexible structures that form the average value of several real episodes and build a kind of prototype that represents them. RUV is something that never happened quite like this; at the same time, it does not contain anything that has not happened at least once. RUVs are important emotional elements of our interaction patterns and our attitudes or expectations. Memories contained in the RUV can be called as long as at least one of the RUV attributes is present. When an infant has a certain feeling or experience, it can evoke in the infant's memory the same RUV with which that feeling is associated. These emotional attributes are also related to memories, as they represent the reactivation of past experiences.</p>
                                            <p>At first glance, it seems surprising that Stern does not attach much importance to the distinction between a self-regulating other that is present and one that is absent. He feels that the infant is in any case dealing with his past, lived experience of living with another up to this very moment. Even if the mother is literally present, the infant also lives in his subjective experience of being together, with a regulated, historical other, with what came before.</p>
                                            <p>Stern calls this "being with a summoned companion." I think the term "evoked companion" is a bit confusing, as it's not so much about the actual person, but rather the invocation of a state that usually occurs when being with another. In other words, it's not necessarily actually another person; rather, it can be a fantasy about the situation of being with her. These are latent or active ideas or fantasies about interactions with another. The idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;a summoned companion serves to evaluate the present, "actual" circumstance through comparison. And this comparison solves the question: what is new, what is different in the current situation? That is, this analysis criterion was developed thanks to the generalization of memories of past interactions. And this criterion serves to assess the actual current situation. The new situation, from this moment on, at least a little, will change RUV. So, former RUVs will be gradually modified and updated due to current experience. With this in mind, Stern says something very important for psychotherapists. He writes:&nbsp;<em>“The more past experience there is, the less change or relative impact any single particular episode will have. History builds inertia "(Stern, 1985, p. 113). </em>&nbsp;I feel that this explains why so many new experiences and evaluations are needed during analysis, and why it can take so long to modify certain imprints of interaction patterns, especially when there is resistance or interfering "complexes". These RUVs can be considered the precursors of what Jungians call complexes. But we will return to the question of RUV and mental complexes, in Jung's understanding, more fully below.</p>
                                            <p>Each infant, without realizing it, lives perhaps all the time in memories of past interactions. This is the case whether or not the individuals involved in these interactions are present or absent. Thus, summoned companions of various characters, in everyday life, are constant companions. Stern quite rightly asks if the same phenomenon does not apply to adults when they do not concentrate on certain tasks? He writes, “How much time each day we spend in imaginary interactions that are either memories, or fantasies about future events, or dreams” (Stern, 1985, p. 118).</p>
                                            <p>Thanks to these memories, the baby is rarely alone during the first few years of life. It constantly interacts, sometimes with real external partners; and almost always with invited companions. Development involves a constant, usually silent, dialogue between two partners. In any case, according to Stern, subjective experience is largely socially determined, regardless of whether one is actually alone with oneself. But I want to emphasize once again that representations always have a form that is more or less generalized and are not limited only to the evoked own mother. From a Jungian perspective, our ability to form representations from countless, varied experiences can be said to belong to the creative, organizing force that Jung called the archetype.</p>
                                            <p>It should be added here that Stern seems to be no longer satisfied with his ideas about Representations of Generalized Interactions - RUV. Recently, he replaced this concept with the term "scheme of being with". According to Stern, the difference between the "scheme of being with" and the RUV is that the former more accurately captures the interaction from the subjective point of view of the infant, while the RUV is more understandable from the objective point of view of adults who view the interaction from the outside (Stern , 1996). This "scheme of being with" consists of five aspects, which Stern carefully analyzes.</p>
                                            <p>It seems to me that Stern, whose lectures I found surprisingly intuitive and focused on experiences, eventually feels the need to analyze in minute detail this sensory-intuitive way of conceptualizing. He dissects the subject to such an extent that it becomes more and more abstract; and can be grasped only with an intellectual "stretch". In this book, I will stick with this earlier understanding related to the concept of RUV, because the term is intuitive and clearly differentiates the relevant data. Instead, it stays closer to the real, tangible experience. (For those interested, the "scheme of being with" is very well explained in Stern's later book, Constellations of Motherhood (1995; see Chapter 5).)</p>
