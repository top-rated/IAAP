                                            <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                            <p>In a recent exchange in this journal, Warren Colman, Elizabeth Urban, and I wrestled with the disconnect between the language we use and the observations described in that language. Fordham's concept of the self was at the center of this debate among colleagues. We seemed to disagree with each other, but a closer examination of our language allowed us to arrive at a juxtaposition of views that were not inherently contradictory (Astor 2009; Colman 2009; Urban 2009). The problem was that one person's clarity of expression was another person's misconception.</p>
                                            <h4>Internal discourse</h4>
                                            <p>When we try to understand something, we say we grasp it. But we can never achieve an understanding that is more than adequate for the task. Like parenting, language can be, at best, only "good enough," but it can never be complete or perfect. Analysts and patients, readers and writers are united by the fact that they are influenced by the music of words, the truth or falsity of the silent part of communication. The title of this essay refers to the experience of being an analyst. We try to say what we mean, this involves understanding the other person's communication, finding the right words to describe what we have understood and expressing them in a tone of voice that can be heard. When we begin our training as analysts, we borrow, imitate, and "try on" other people's voices until we find our own. Sometimes what we want to describe is noetic, other times ineffable, especially when it comes to numinous experiences. Finding words is not an easy task. It is no wonder that our interpretations can alienate our patients as our words attempt to convey our moments of understanding and enlightenment. One of my supervisors read Shakespeare to improve his expression. But improving our expression involves more than simply expressing more clearly, but also conveying the emotional meaning of what we're trying to say. Often during the session I would have a dull flash of thought, only to see it disappear, as if it were a landscape briefly illuminated by lightning in the night. Poetry is usually better at this task, let's not forget, of course, that poets describe their own states of mind, and our task is to describe the states of mind of our patients. Freud believed that the language of imagination better expresses the human condition, and wrote that "his medical histories should be read like short stories" (Freud 1893, p. 160). Novelists say they don't set out to write a book about anything. They begin, in the words of Martin Amis, with a "premonition" or, in Nabokov's language, with a "tremor" or "pulsation." It can come from anywhere, but as Amis writes: "The decisive fermentation, that is, the one that becomes the impetus, is that the tremor must combine with something already present in the subconscious" (Amis 23.1.2010). This also applies to interpretation. Auden distinguished between formal and free verse: the former is similar to carving, the latter to modeling: that they don't set out to write a book about something. They begin, in the words of Martin Amis, with a "premonition" or, in Nabokov's language, with a "tremor" or "pulsation." It can come from anywhere, but as Amis writes: "The decisive fermentation, that is, the one that becomes the impetus, is that the tremor must combine with something already present in the subconscious" (Amis 23.1.2010).

                                            <blockquote><p>"a formal poet ... thinks of the poem he writes as something hidden (latent) in language, something that he has to reveal, while a free verse poet thinks of language as a plastic passive medium on which he imposes his artistic concept (Auden 1962, p. 287)</p></blockquote>
                                            <p class="p1">There is no value judgment here. As analysts, we use both carving and modeling techniques. We use a carving technique where the words come directly into our consciousness from the subconscious, as if we were seeing a form in stone. Instead, when we use modeling techniques, we conceptualize in an effort to put raw impressions, intuitions, and feelings into appropriate words.</p>
                                            <h4 class="p1"><b>Speaking the same language</b></h4>
                                            <p class="p2">Those who have played team games may remember the coach asking them, when they were down after a hard fight with an opponent, if they were hurt or injured? If they were just hurt, fine - "play on", but if they were injured - they had to sit on the bench. Our patients come to us traumatized (injured), with memories that hide the essence of the matter. They come with their narrative, but it contains no explanatory meaning. And while we seek to aim our words precisely at a node in the patient's psyche, calling something in other words runs the risk of being perceived as trying to simplify the individual. How often do we actually hear, “We just don't speak the same language”, maybe even at an IAAP conference, one colleague says something similar to another. By saying this, we mean that although the essence may have coincided, but we didn't meet. A vivid example is the way someone uses the word "transfer". (I will return to this later).</p>
                                            <p class="p2">The meaning of what we say is about our authenticity and that our words are sincere. In his article in this journal entitled "What Works?" K. described a special experience of interpretation by one of his analysts:</p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                            <p class="p4"><i>His interpretations could indeed sound mechanical, for they were comparatively unaffecting.... Being born in his psyche, I naturally received them in my own psyche, grasped and understood them intellectually, but remained emotionally unmoved by them. It is in this sense and for this reason, and not due to any blocking, cancellation or deliberate forgetting on my part, that they fell away (disappeared) and became "meaningless" to me.</i></p>
                                            <p class="p5"><i>(K 2007, page 221)</i></p>
                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p class="p1">Older generations of analysts wrestled with the feelings their patients evoked in them. At first they were seen as noise in the mechanism of their psyche, and then, following Jung, they began to understand that this is purposeful communication. McAlister, in her recent report for the SAP analytical group, described how she worked with patients who were hospitalized in special security units (secur units) because they had literally killed the object of their paranoia. By focusing on the projective content of her patients' communication, especially when they activated identifying affects in her, she was able to approach the edge of death of her patient's inner world. She wrote the following:</p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                            <p class="p3"><i>In my countertransference with Mr. D, I often felt tired, bored, confused, and withdrawn, mostly due to his extreme specificity and turning words into dead sounds. By creating a rigid structure that stopped creative thought both in his mind and between us in the sessions, he created a kind of killing zone that destroyed everything that could allow him to move on and progress."</i></p>
                                            <p class="p4">(McAlister 2009)</p>
                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p class="p1">Her patient's feelings were detached from his words. He sounded like an automaton, saying what he thought was expected of him, while McAllister, as his analyst, was aware of the underlying affect. It was through processing these feelings present beneath the surface of her patient's words that she was able to create her interpretations to describe to him the constant presence of his murderous rage and its source.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">K., describing the other side of the dialogue, pointed out how important it was for him that later he encountered, unlike his previous experience, "feelings and emotions" in his analyst's messages. They were not always, but often enough to make a difference. He felt that he was not alone in his pain. He wrote:</p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                            <p class="p6"><i>What it speaks of is a connectedness of feelings, and without such a connectedness I do not think that it would be possible to undergo analysis. It reflects what Joseph Conrad called "the subtle but invincible conviction of solidarity" that binds people together - "the dead with the living and the living with the unborn."</i></p>
                                            <p class="p4">(K. 2007, page 208)</p>
                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p class="p1">This connection was completely absent in McAllister's patient, who repeated what she called "his mantra." The essence of the "mantra" was that he was "sick" and now "safe" - it was a way to keep thoughts and feelings out of his mind that could reconnect him with humanity. His mechanical repetition of standard phrases was imitative, stuck, rote, but did not arise organically from an altered consciousness. So, it was a barrier to suffering from the realization that he had completely destroyed the lives of three people.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">Language that resonates and touches something unconscious in the hearer can shape his psychic reality, but not by will (desire), but rather by imagination and inspiration, which expand knowledge in the form of symbols created mysteriously beyond the Ego. The acquisition of wisdom and insight changes the structure of consciousness, as long as they come from the experience of imagining the world of the Other, and as a result, the idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;how the Other imagines me in his world.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">Coleridge (1826) writes: "All knowledge that enlightens and liberates is a form and a means of self-knowledge." We "become" someone else, not just "master" new knowledge, paraphrasing Coleridge (1808, p. 188). From an analytical perspective, the creation of this language depends, in Coleridge's words, on a “voluntary suspension of disbelief” in our internal discourse from which our interpretations derive. In Coleridge's model of the psyche, when knowledge becomes real, becoming self-knowledge, the psyche grows.</p>
                                            <h4 class="p3"><b>We learn to listen</b></h4>
                                            <p class="p1">As an analyst, I mean <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>that I try to facilitate the mentalization of affective states that affect my patients' lives, but of which they are unconscious. Fonagy and Target (Fonagy and Target) describe the integration of "pretense" and "mental equivalence" as modes of functioning <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>in child development, around the age of four or five, which the authors call "mentalization."</p>
                                            <p class="p1">Through this new way of making sense of his experience, the child not only demonstrates an understanding that his own behavior and the behavior of his object make sense in terms of mental states (in terms of mental states), but also becomes able to recognize that these states are representations, which can be wrong and change because they are based on only one of a number of possible points of view. However, this progress can also lead to a significant increase in conflict when phantasies such as Oedipal desires become stable representations that can then be contrasted with external reality.</p>

                                            <p class="p4"><i>In order to achieve the integration of these two modes of experience, to create a fully mentalizing mental reality, the child needs repeated experience of three things: his current feelings and thoughts, these mental states reflected (reflected) in the mind of the object, and the framework presented, usually from the reality-oriented point of view of an adult. The "frame" provided by a parent or other children seems to us to be an important part of this model. A child needs an adult or an older child who "plays with him" so that the child sees his fantasy or idea reflected in the adult's mind, re-introjects it and uses it as a representation of his own thinking.</i></p>

                                            <p class="p1">Many who turn to analysis have not integrated this way of functioning of "pretense" and "psychic equivalence" and cannot tolerate the conflicts they generate, and one of the functions of language that comes out of the "I" is really felt and really has in mind - to show the patient that his feelings are understood by others, that others also think about these feelings. It is a theory of consciousness compatible with Coleridge's, and in referring to Coleridge I draw on a tradition in English literature that articulates the problems we face as analysts, namely, trying to give form to the unknown that is hidden within us in order to then it became part of us.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">In connection with this, I now think that when working in the field of borderline states of the psyche, reasonable self-disclosure can be useful. This is different from my early years as an analyst, when I believed that self-disclosure was inappropriate and could confuse (confuse) the patient. Let me outline what I mean by self-disclosure.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">I interrupted the interpretation, which I felt had no effect and was getting too messy, by saying out loud, "Too many words, too many words." This is an interpretation for myself. The consequence of this was: a) relief for the listener and b) indicating to him that irony remained alive in our meeting, and with it, trust. He looked more and more incredulous as I continued. And when I noticed this, I was able to change the picture in my perception of him, which allowed him to change his perception of me. Through this two-way process, we both learned that both he and I had an internal representation that had been overlooked.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">By listening and experiencing the affective content of what is said, we learn to find the best way to communicate with our patients. But we must remember how to distinguish this from the action of countertransference. It occurs when we become too identified (identified) with the projected element of the received projective identification. Here is an example of a psychotherapist caught up in a multi-layered projective identification manifested in transference.</p>
                                            <h4 class="p3"><b>Caught in projective identification</b></h4>
                                            <p class="p1">The mentioned material happened after a short summer break. The therapist was the supervisor (male) and the description below refers to the session in which the therapist taught me this material. The patient (female) canceled the first session this week because her child had an accident and was going to cancel the first session next week.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">The therapist began his story by emphasizing that the patient looked sad. When she entered, she said she woke up sad, but she had no reason to be sad. The therapist brushed it off and said he had no thoughts on the conversation and it didn't occur to him at the time that she missed sessions because her baby was hurt. The session continued. He heard her say that she was worried and depressed, and then she ended the line with a question: "Is it really true?".</p>
                                            <p class="p1">He said to her: "Can you tell me more about it?". She agreed and quite unconsciously said: "Well, it would be nice if someone came to me in the last few days to cheer me up (raise my spirits)." As he read it, he said to me, "I see that there is a hint of transference here, but every time I say something that relates to me, she says, 'I understand why you say that, but I don't feel it”… so, anticipating this, he said nothing and stopped thinking about it. His idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;transference is that the patient is making covert references to him, and he must bring them to her attention.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">Now the patient said: “Well, I'm not one of those people who ask for help. I will never call a friend and say I'm sick, please come visit. It will ruin my reputation as a person who can cope." He again invited his patient to elaborate on what she had just said. This time she said something about the fact that these were not the feelings that were customary to talk about in the family. And from her experience, you can talk about these feelings only if someone else notices them. Again, he didn't notice, especially that there might be some implicit criticism here, that perhaps she was signaling that he hadn't noticed that there were emotional events going on between them that combined feelings of sadness and loss that she needed to deal with. help to cope This is an example of how a state of project identification has taken over the dialogue between these two people,</p>
                                            <h4 class="p1"><b>Language and levels of intervention</b></h4>
                                            <p class="p2">If he were to intervene, what level of intervention and language would be appropriate? He might say, "I think you're telling me that you wish you had a caring dad, but you don't want to think about it because it makes you sad." That's right, but isn't it too far removed from the current feelings. This is reconstruction, and while reconstruction has its place, it usually adds meaning after the topic has been worked through at the time of the clinical situation. Or he could say, as he has said in the past, "You don't like having these thoughts because you think they're about me, and you're worried that those thoughts about me are inappropriate." This is a reference to Oedipal transference, but at a distance that is comfortable enough to be abandoned. Or he could say, “What you are talking about is happening here and now, you are full of feelings, which you don't pay attention to, and we don't think about them together." This opens up the possibility of further research into her state of mind.</p>
                                            <p class="p2">Here, the linguistic and mental levels of interventions are combined. The first interpretation is almost educational, addressed to the Ego, which considers this comment dystonic. This is how your unconscious works, says the analyst, but in a manner that is unlikely to interest the patient. The next option objectifies and describes the inner world of the patient. A third option, which I prefer, is the recognition that the analyst and the patient are engaged together in acting out a familiar story from the patient's life. And it seems that the meaning of this play is that the patient wants to understand something from this situation. The way she does it suggests that she would like to invite the analyst to this understanding. (This also constellates the protection of both the patient and the analyst). This is transference/countertransference. This is what I mean when I say that I analyze the transference.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">Another way analysts react in countertransference is when they become stuck in silence because of some sort of inhibition or idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;deliberately delaying speech. This can hinder further exploration of what emerges, as well as creating an atmosphere in which knowledge is received but not transmitted, and this can be dangerously close to the accumulation of secret thoughts. And secret thoughts about the patient can lead the analyst to the path of omniscience. The effect of this on our patients is that they become more passive and, if the analyst is very silent, even angry. For example, one analyst who was silent with an overbearing patient ended a supervision with me by saying, when I called time, "Is that all?" In other words, it was the best I could do. Supervision revealed how disrespectful the patient treated him, and how angry this made him, and that as he fought to contain the irritation. This was expressed in his last comment to me. His emotional problem arose from an indiscernible connection between his own feelings of inferiority and the patient's anxiety. He couldn't find the words until he realized what he and his patient were feeling. He didn't realize how angry he was at being treated with contempt by the patient until he started treating me the same way.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">Until recently, I assumed that it was language filled with unprocessed projective identity content that created the greatest difficulties. For example, Bion's work on projective identification as part of normal communication refers to deep levels of nonverbal communication understood through the reverie of the recipient, who finds words first as internal verbalizations and then as vocalizations in utterance (Bion 1967). Knox, in her article in this journal entitled "When Words Don't Mean What They Say," examined this topic from the perspective of subjectivity and the coercive use of language. She linked Deacon's indexical language to early archetypal patterns of behavior and the compulsive nature of infant communication (Deacon 1997). She also showed how, for example, indexical language, persisting into adulthood, conveys menace in the unspoken, as illustrated, for example, in the works of Pinter (Knox 2009). Indexical language is what Knox described as the intention to exert a direct behavioral influence on the analyst. Patient McAllister, by using clichés such as "awareness of his crime," "coping strategies," or "recognition of stress triggers," was essentially giving covert instructions to his analyst that he should be released from custody at a time when as an analyst she knew that he had lingering psychosis and had succumbed to an ideology of militancy that destroyed his humanity.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">There is also a lexical language that we use for ordinary communication, and the latter is a metaphorical language. In addition, following Wittgenstein, we conceptualize communications as deep or surface. Much of what we think of as evacuation, not communication, is surface language. Vocabulary is part of what makes up the vocabulary of our history, both personal and impersonal, and it can also be used to express our protective organizations.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">I make no claim to the completeness or originality of this formulation. And the categories are not as clear as I have made them for this presentation. Some of these have been introduced in the psychotherapy literature over the years (see Meltzer et al. 1975), drawn from philosophy (Langer 1942) and linguistics. Some of them have appeared quite recently, such as the work of Deacon (Deacon 1997) and Knox.</p>
                                            <h4 class="p3"><b>Bion and Jung</b></h4>
                                            <p class="p1">For language to develop, we must want to communicate. It sounds trite, but it often seems that autistic children do not want to communicate with other people. Then there must be someone who exists within us - in our psychic reality, someone to whom we turn. In schizophrenia, this internal figure is part of the delusional system.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">Our use of language is based on the concept of "dream thoughts" formulated by Bion. They can be understood, they also form part of our memory and therefore can be conveyed in language that can be superficial or deep. Now we need some operational concept. This is an alpha function. Without the alpha function, we are deprived of the alpha elements that actually create the thoughts of the dream and without which these thoughts cannot be formulated<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>(Bion 1967). This is where Jung and Bion converge. Jung's assertion that physical (external) reality and mental (internal) reality are two aspects of the same entity that we experience separately gives rise to a psychosomatic approach to understanding human nature. However, Jung's psychic needs Bion's mechanism of alpha function, which transforms the sensations experienced by the infant into elements that can be thought about. And Bion's psychic needs Jung's transcendental function to integrate Bion's various vertices. Like Jung, Bion was interested in psychoses, and like Jung, Bion was interested in the search for meaning. Dream thoughts are the basis of meaningful intimate communication. The transcendental function reconciles the contradictions that arise through symbolic integration and is important in the context of depression. When I first encountered the concept of dream thoughts, I struggled to understand why it was so important. Surely, said my inner skeptic, we don't have to dream to think? This is not so - thoughts in a dream refer to the inner dreaminess about our object of attachment, which gives rise to thinking. I mean here the sources of imagination, not the transmission of information. Einstein makes the distinction when he describes how ideas come to him:</p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                            <p class="p3"><i>Words or speech, as written or spoken, play no part in the mechanism of my thinking. Mental entities, which seem to serve as elements of thinking, are ordinary signs and more or less clear images that can be "voluntarily" reproduced and combined... The above-mentioned elements, in my case, are of a visual and muscular type. Generally accepted words or other signs have to be carefully searched for only at the second stage, when the mentioned associative game is quite established and can be reproduced at will</i></p>

                                            <p class="p1">Colman suggested (private communication) that Einstein "carved" that (Auden reference above), but not in words, which he then had to translate into his imaginative activities in language and mathematics.</p>
                                            <h4 class="p1"><b>The language of interpretation</b></h4>
                                            <p class="p2">I have already mentioned the prohibitions that arise when we identify with projective material, and now I want to consider the psychopathology of the patient. K., who described himself as living in a borderline zone, revealed that he experienced the analyst's benevolent neutrality as indifference to his pain. As analysts, we think of our benevolent neutrality as something about what our patients bring, not their personalities. We don't judge, but it affects us. Often our patients do not understand this. In her recent article, Urban described two children she observed in a hospital clinic where she worked. One of them had a psychotic personality structure, the other a neurotic one. A psychotic child, whose behavior was manic and physiological, could not stand many words. Worked with it mainly by restricting what what she was being told, and focused more on her reactions to her feelings at the time of the session. Urban did this by connecting the child's unspoken thoughts and actions. The seeds of a rudimentary trust in his analytic object appeared when a child crawled through Urban's trousers during a reenactment of his birth. This kid felt like a piece of shit, pushed out, unwanted, smelly and useless, and acted accordingly. Language was in the form of a child and behaved accordingly. Language was in the form of a child and behaved accordingly. Language was in the form of a child<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>and tone of voice. "Why hello," said Urbban, when the child crawled between her legs to be greeted with a friendly smile and a warm expression on her face. In contrast, the neurotic child could hear interpretations. Here are Urban's words:</p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                            <p class="p3"><i>The aggression was evident in the pictures of her mother with a big mouth and then with a black hole instead of a mouth. I asked questions about these drawings and made comments. I assumed that the beautiful pictures she had drawn so carefully showed how much she wanted everything to be great for her family. My questions made her anxious, probably caused by the meetings she was having with the court guardian at the time. As she drew an unknown figure with a huge mouth, she laughed in surprise when I said she wished I would shut my big mouth and stop asking questions. When this happened, she asked, “How do you know I think that? "</i></p>

                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p class="p1">To me, this meant that both the analyst's behavioral and linguistic interpretation gave expression to something in the child's subconscious. This example illustrates three levels of language. The patient's messages were lexical, deep (in terms of their projective identification content), and their expression was metaphorical. It is from these imaginary exchanges that symbols can emerge.</p>
                                            <p class="p7"><b>Grammar of interpretations</b></p>
                                            <p class="p1">But often we have to choose which of the interventions to apply. Anne Alvarez (Anne Alvarez) drew attention to the grammar of interpretations in the analysis of the borderline child. When analyzing a borderline child, we can choose, for example, to focus on the child's omnipotence or his powers. Bearing in mind the concreteness inherent in boundary thinking and the fact that any interpretation that suggests separateness or difference is intolerable. We have to be careful when formulating our interventions because often <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>in these cases the person has neither confidence in their inner objects nor a sense that they are someone worth listening to and being heard.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">Alvarez found that neurotic children can hear and understand sentences that have a conditional or subjunctive structure, so she can tell them, "You want to, but we both know you can't..." and thanking that the neurotic child has " sufficient' Ego to account for two different possibilities, this statement is possible. Whereas in the case of a borderline child, she will have to say something with more confidence and assurance, for example, "You feel that I should not leave you at this time." She cites the example of a 10-year-old child who spoke anxiously about workers painting the building where the sessions were held. Álvarez interpreted that the child would like to be able to paint like adult workers, to do what dad often did. The child corrected her: "Yes, I want, I really want it, I really work, that's what I do, you see" (Alvarez 1997, p. 759). The analyst's formulation is aimed at his omnipotence. He would like to be like his father. But the child corrects the analyst and emphasizes her power because she needed to feel that she could be strong and capable of recovery. The child turned "I would like to do" into "this is what I do." The first example is the classic interpretation as studied, namely, the analyst refers to the patient's defense and identification with this point of view. The adjustment of the child is the beginning of a process which, if the analyst can allow it, will lead to the transference child creating a new story for himself. The analyst's interpretation reminds the child of his pain. The child's interpretation refers to the hope that his crazy inner world of irrational fears and insecurities can be reconciled.

                                            <p class="p1">Alvarez (1997) invites the reader to consider what his own model is as an analyst at the moment of interpretation. Because if the interpretations constantly expose the patient's vulnerabilities, the patient begins to feel despair and, ultimately, rejection. The child she tells about was abandoned by her mother when she was four years old, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>this child declared in therapy that he would stay with his mother forever. Clarification interprets this as a desire based on the fear that the mother will never return, reinforced by the reality of the mother's absence. The transference potential, which could allow us to treat this in a different way - to accept the child's desire to be with a good mother always, which is a prerequisite for such transference. A transfer that provides continuity, that a warm sense of continuity can be similar to a feeling of support and a hug is a good early childhood experience that a child needs.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">The idea here is that if the child is not overwhelmed with anxiety, perhaps his Ego can grow a little; perhaps she will be able to feel some confidence in her analyst and have a different transference experience. I have detailed various aspects of this in previous works, which reveal my interest in how to avoid closing off, rejecting, shutting down, repelling trial approaches (attempts) of those parts of the patient's personality that are trying to develop (Astor 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007).</p>
                                            <h4 class="p1"><b>The need to be understood and the reluctance to achieve understanding</b></h4>
                                            <p class="p2">Finally, I want to dwell briefly on John Steiner's work on patient-centered and analyst-centered interpretations. Steiner starts from the fact that there are patients who do not want to be aware of themselves, but nevertheless show an urgent need to be understood. In order to demonstrate that the patient was comprehensible in such circumstances, the analyst often needs to frame the interpretation in such a way that it refers to what the patient thinks is going on in the analyst's mind. "You perceive me as...", "you are afraid that I...". The patient can be interested in what the analyst thinks, provided the analyst is open and willing to consider the patient's point of view, rather than pointing out that his opinion is wrong. The potential value of this kind of interpretation is that the analyst suggests that the patient a) is interested in his actions and b) is ready to take some responsibility for them. In Steiner's terms, this assumption is in support of the patient's challenge to the dominance of his own internal pathological organization. But analysts also need to be conscious of how they communicate what they understand in terms of intervention levels. By this I mean that we can hear what we are told as describing an infantile state of mind, but know that it is actually inappropriate to talk in this way.</p>
                                            <p class="p2">Steiner's patient had a dream: she was on a mountain top. Next to her, also at the top, was a giant mushroom. She was afraid of being pushed, but at the same time she was stuck there. Her husband said impatiently from somewhere beyond the top: “Come on! We have to move on to get there." Then she added: "He must have been on the way down."</p>
                                            <p class="p2">Steiner's attention was drawn to the fact that moving forward meant going downhill. His internal comment was that the rejection of the nipple for this patient did not mean weaning, "that is, forward movement and development, but displacement and displacement by the mushroom penis." Therefore, if she were a penis or had one, she would always have breasts. So in the language of her dreams, if she could let go of being on top, she could make progress. But the problem was that she thought of it as going downhill. This was a patient who believed that analysands who are in training analysis to become analysts are in a privileged position compared to other analysands. Steiner's interpretation sounded like this: "You feel displaced and humiliated by me because you cannot be like me." To which she replied: “But it is, and I'm sure it always will be,” prompting him to say, “when she realized that accepting an interpretation did not make her an analyst, it was an insight and a step forward, but for her it was like going down a slippery slope to a lower position” (Steiner 1994, p. 1071). This annoyed his patient, but did not humiliate her. And that led him, not her, to the work of dealing with the distress of not being appreciated.</p>
                                            <p class="p1">To me, this is an example of appropriate language for analysis, as the analyst uses identifying elements to keep the focus on the patient's communicative capacity and her willingness to stay with the unconscious process. He consciously assumes the position of her husband and speaks to her using her lexicon. If he had used the language of partial objects, it would have played out in her feelings, that she is inherently inferior, that she has to grow up. He speaks lexically with an adult, metaphorically with a child.</p>
                                            <h4 class="p3"><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
                                            <p class="p1">We must respect the sources of our patients' language and understand their lived experiences and their implications for their ability to listen and hear the voice within our and their verbal and non-verbal communication. Grammatical structure can be important in formulating our interventions and this occurs in a process of mentalization that is reciprocal. Another important element is that analysts need to adjust their way of "being with" their patients by delving into the prevailing structure of their personality. A psychotic cannot hear what a neurotic can hear. Referring to Bion's alpha function, I suggested how thinking occurs and how to start thinking about what happens when sessions are full of evacuated material. And I suggested that intelligent self-disclosure, restrained, carefully edited and limited, rather than a confessional autobiography,</p>
                                            <p class="p1">In our interpretive work, we strive to reach a level of psychic reality that our patients have not previously had access to. The narrative we create together cannot use the language of conventional realism; rather, we must achieve a union that must be compelling enough for us both to feel involved. Remember what Winnicott said in his work on communication: "It is a joy to hide, but a misery not to be found" (Winnicott 1963, p. 186).</p>
