Infancy becomes the central focus of research.</p>
                                            <p>I developed this thesis in two books, <em>Children as Individuals&nbsp;</em> and&nbsp; <em>Self and Autism.&nbsp;</em>I did not rely on Jung's data, but rather abstracted from it, and came to the conclusion that, although the manifestations in the age-related states of the soul were very different, the basic process of individuation was the same. With experience, this position had to be modified somewhat, especially with regard to the observation of mothers and infants.</p>
                                            <p>My ideas developed as follows:</p>
                                            <p>1. I began by looking for symbols of the self in the games and fantasies of young children. They seemed to be connected with the growth of the "I", that is, individuation.</p>
                                            <p>2. These observations lead to speculation about how early the self can be active. I suggested that this is a primary factor, that is, one that allows the child to be seen from the beginning as an integrated personality, separate from the mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>3. It follows that in order to enter into a relationship with the environment, disintegration must take place. Disintegration can be observed during feeding and integration during sleep. Since this sequence is repeated, we can consider sequences of deintegration - integration.</p>
                                            <p>4. According to modern views, disintegration leads to primitive identification. Then, as the "I" grows and develops, the infant emerges from the original state, just as Jung describes it, in relation to the second half of life.</p>
                                            <h4>Appeal to childhood</h4>
                                            <p>As part of the Society for Analytical Psychology (SAP) Child Analysis training, with the help of Gianna Henry from the Tavistock Clinic, I initiated research and workshops on observing mothers and babies. The students were observed every week, starting, if possible, from birth, for two years. They presented their findings at weekly seminars that I attended. I am deeply grateful to both the students and Mrs. Henry for the opportunity to use this material. From their reports and discussions, I became convinced that my hypothesis contributed to the observations. Moreover, the statement about the infant's self was based on something more fundamental, such as a description of the facts of the infant's life. What began as an imaginary hypothesis has acquired the signs of a fact: the child demonstrates that he is a person whose nature is constantly recognizable (in the continuity of his being), has its own individuality (no child is the same as another). Applying the idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;disintegration in the study of childhood, it is necessary, first of all, to understand the process by which an integrated infant, initially separated from his mother, is able to enter into a relationship with her.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Observation</em></h4>
                                            <p>Here is an observation made when the baby was two weeks old. (I am grateful for the example of Annie Brown).</p>
                                            <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                                            <p>Baby H was lying in the bassinet on his right side, with his right arm extended under his body and his left arm bent so that the hand was near his face. The head, which was softly covered with curls of black hair, touched the top edge of the cradle and F, [his mother] said that he crawled this way himself, all the way to the very top of the cradle. His eyes were open, and he was slightly moving his whole body, a little restless (it seemed that he had not yet woken up, but he was not asleep either). F said that he must be hungry by now as it was feeding time. Later, N suddenly calmed down and lay completely still for several minutes, looking at the cradle with his black eyes.</p>
                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p>Then, for a certain period, the observation was interrupted, taking into account F.'s story about the unusual circumstances of the birth of N., who was her "Christmas child". Therefore, the observation continued:</p>
                                            <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                                            <p>F. took N and gave it to me [the observer]. N was lying in my arms, staring intently into my face, often opening his mouth and making sounds. I [the observer] spoke to him, and he answered, constantly looking into my face. A few times H looked like he was trying to smile and finally he smiled slightly in response to my chatter. Then he looked away, as if surveying the room, and when I spoke again, turned his head towards me, looking in the direction of my face, unable to concentrate immediately.</p>
                                            <p>I continued to hold N. while F. drank coffee. She spoke to N. tenderly and with love, smiling enthusiastically at him and saying that she could not believe that he really existed! Then, she took the baby and put it to her right breast to feed. It took several attempts for N. to pull the nipple properly into his mouth, but later he sucked and hiccupped loudly and greedily. . . . N. sucked energetically, occasionally stopping to rest. At first his eyes were wide open, but after a few minutes they closed while he continued to suck... F. put him to her left breast, and he sucked energetically, grunting a little while looking up intently. I thought he was trying to see her face, but F said he was looking at her red jumper. Then he fell asleep and stopped sucking.</p>
                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p>Among the many interactions between mother and child, all of which were very interesting, I chose this particular description. In it, in my opinion, you can look into his fetal life and imagine what it could have been like (when he was lying in the cradle), observing the rather good relationship that developed between the mother and the child, which was repeatedly evident before, under breastfeeding time. In general, we see the development of events, which begins with an internal movement in the child, with the assistance of F. and the observer, who are focused on feeding. When the baby is fed to his heart's content, he falls asleep. Exactly as I imagined the deintegrative-integrative sequence.</p>
                                            <p>By expanding the concept&nbsp; <em>of the innate trigger mechanism </em><a href="https://jungians.kiev.ua/book/integracziya-deintegracziya-v-dytynstvi/#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a> , it would be possible to justify the movement that comes from the inside and leads to the awakening and feeding of N., but it is much easier to explain N.'s anxiety as a signal from the mother that he is hungry, a signal that she also feels intuitively.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>I agree with those (eg Bowlby, 1969) who want to bring our thinking into line with biological concepts. First of all, because of the idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;adaptation. This concept remains useful, although it has turned into a kind of mechanical concession to the realities of the environment. But in a deep sense, adaptation is something much more, it includes the impact and subjugation of reality as part of the struggle for existence. In this sense, a child is already born with the ability to adapt, so the sequence that we have considered is the basic foundation, it can already be built and developed.</p>
                                            <p>The innate information of the trigger mechanism is encoded as simply as possible, provided that its action should be unlikely in biologically inappropriate situations. A classic example of simple, but completely sufficient information for an animal in natural conditions is the VMZ, which causes a bite reaction in an ordinary tick (Ixodes rhicinus). As Jakob von Juxkühl showed, the tick bites anything that has a temperature of 37 ° C and smells of butyric acid. As simple as this characteristic of the tick's natural host, a mammal, is, it is equally incredible that this reaction could be caused by some other, common object in the forest.</p>

                                            <p>I agree with those (eg Bowlby, 1969) who want to bring our thinking into line with biological concepts. First is the idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;adaptation. This concept remains useful, although it has turned into a kind of mechanical concession to the realities of the environment. But in the best sense, it is something much more, and includes the influence and subjugation of reality as part of the struggle for existence. In this sense, a child is already born with the ability to adapt, so the sequence that we have considered is the basic foundation, it can already be built and developed.</p>
                                            <p>Previously, my reasoning was hindered by the idea that the infant's perceptual apparatus is very limited or vague, so one of the revolutionary achievements of recent years has been the discovery that the perception of the baby is well developed: it can track accurately and hear selectively. But if we dare to trust our observations and draw conclusions from them, we will see something more. If mothers and babies are closely observed, it seems that they are capable of being aware of each other's existence as a whole. We know that babies are endowed with behavior aimed at attachment to their own mother. However, more recently it has become apparent that they also behave in ways that elicit their mothers' love for them, and have a large number of signals to indicate their needs, they smile, look, cry, grunt, nest, etc. A more impressive ability is that they seem to be aware of the mother's emotional abilities. In seminars on observing infant mothers, N. forced the participants to think of him as a "sparing" child: his mother had a very low tolerance for aggression, and her internal resources were limited. Baby N. seemed to know this and got the best out of her at a very early stage, avoiding any aggressive chest attacks or excessive screaming etc. Baby N. was not too unique, and I would like to mention another child whose mother was very insecure about her mothering skills. The baby gave her such clear signs of what he needed that, guided by them, she discovered something in herself that allowed her to literally become a "pretty good mother" under the guidance of her child. It seemed that the child should only be near the breast, so that she could find her way to the breast and feed comfortably if the mother followed his signals and understood them correctly. Of course, there are other babies, not so helpful at all, who take the breast with difficulty or even reject it.</p>
                                            <p>Why do I think disintegration theory gives meaning to such observations? Other theories do not take into account the response of the organism as a whole. It is true that Freud used the vivid allegory of the amoeba throwing out pseudopodia <sup>2</sup>, sometimes attributing this action to the function of the Id, sometimes to the Ego, but he never thought that energy could come from the self. The fact that he did not do this may be explained by his analytical mindset. The concept of self is exclusively "pre-" or "post-" analytic. This is the kind of concept that would have been anathema in biology and physiology circles when I was at Cambridge because it interfered with the application of physics and chemistry to the development of those sciences. I hope that we have dismissed, or rather relativized, this type of reasoning for psychology, where a shift has apparently occurred as the experience of the self becomes paramount to many analytic impulses.</p>
                                            <p>But the interpolation does not actually answer the question: "Why do I think that the theory makes it easier to observe the child?" Because it focuses on exactly what the child does&nbsp; <em>as a person</em> . Although, it must be admitted that everything he does is mostly unfolding in the relationship with his mother, nevertheless, his actions remain his own, even under adverse circumstances. It also makes it possible to use language in relation to the child as a whole person. It looks like the language that mothers usually use for their babies, so isn't this language real? After all, they have the most experience with babies more than anyone, so maybe they're right?</p>
                                            <p>One of the achievements of the idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;disintegration in the study of childhood was the improvement of the infant's ability to recognize his own abilities and to emphasize his individuality. The self became so associated with integration that it was difficult to look at the non-symbolizing infant as a separate individual who not only needed more integration, but longed for something else that freed his capacity for adaptation without dissolving his personality. This is precisely what the idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;disintegration illuminates, that the disintegrated is endowed with the self and is continuous with the self.</p>
                                            <p>In the light of these considerations, it seems likely that the infant is capable of acquiring a whole range of experiences. It does not simply function in a continuous state of primordial identification, in which subject and object are indistinguishable, and thought and action are one. The infant shows signs of this mental state, but does not do so continuously. There is no longer just one characteristic mental state, there are already several. Also, there is no longer a stage of primary identification, and it is for this reason that the view of individuation that I followed earlier needs improvement. Thus, the infant is a person from the very beginning, and his individuation occurs through the development of self-representations.</p>
                                            <p>Nevertheless, primitive identity played an important role in the formation of the thinking of analytical psychologists. As a hypothesis explaining&nbsp; <em>the participation </em><em>mystique </em><em>,&nbsp;</em> it has opened up a whole field of research. But before Jung and most of his followers could tap into its psychodynamic potential, Melanie Klein had already done so. She developed the concept of "paranoid-schizoid position". This position is associated, according to Segal (1957), with the non-differentiation between subject and object (symbolic equation), a phenomenon that Klein explored in her work on identification (1955). In this work, she distinguished special types of identification and named projective and introjective identifications.</p>
                                            <p>Another important concept was the "depressed position". If the paranoid-schizoid position highlights primitive identification (primitive identity) and is the result of disintegration, the depressive position highlights integration and individuation.</p>
                                            <p>Another conclusion of my reflections is that we need to study the infant's relationship with objects much more carefully.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Object relations</em></h4>
                                            <p>It seems that baby N. was quite capable of assessing his mother's reality and knew how to act accordingly - the most obvious thing was that he knew how to grasp a nipple with his mouth. Both this and many other features of his relationship, which we have to study, testify to the ability of the infant to adapt to the mother. However, we want to believe that the theories we are used to are suitable for young children: we want to show how the baby relies on its archetypal abilities, how it progresses from unconsciousness to consciousness and the development of the "I", we want to find evidence of primary identification and growth as a characteristic activity unconscious mental processes.</p>
                                            <p>When I began to study the characteristics of a real baby in relation to its mother, I was wildly disappointed when I realized how far from being even remotely useful many of the current theories and views. There is no adequate theory of infant experience, but the need for one seems to have led to premature generalizations. However, if we can refrain from over-generalizing, much of what is presented theoretically can be turned into tools for improving observations. Therefore, I believe that in addition to the idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;interspersed disintegration-integration, the concept of archetypes is still fruitful, as it refers to innate patterns of behavior that have mental accompanying circumstances. The boundaries of the archetype are not fixed, they change dynamically, which contributes to a rapid catechetic (emotional-investment) shift,</p>
                                            <p>Another interesting Jungian idea is that archetypes have a psychoid pole that is very close to, or even coincides with, bodily states (Jung, 1954b). Guided by these considerations, I came close to Bion's postulate of beta elements, which have a close, if not quite identical, meaning. He, however, successfully developed it by relating it to the development of the alpha function. Alpha elements form the basis for the development of thoughts, dreams and myths. Beta elements may be correlated with primary deintegrates. They are as much mental as they are physical, although they express themselves, according to our ability to perceive, precisely physically.</p>
                                            <p>This reflection easily leads to a superficial division into the psyche and the soma, but such an awareness makes it possible to conclude that at the very beginning such dividing ideas as "body-psyche" or "conscious-unconscious" are uninvited guests. In the period of development in question, we meet precisely the self that Jung discovered for us, the one that unites and transcends opposites.</p>
                                            <p>I focus on the nature of infant objects precisely because so much has been said about their unrealism. On the contrary, the claim that they are not at all adapted to reality is deeply wrong. It is true that, along with his sophisticated adaptive behavior, the infant endows his mother with unrealistic features and probably sees her in many ways that are almost impossible for us adults to fathom and thoroughly illustrate with most observational material. We assume that the act of perception, both in adults and in children, is an active event, taking into account also that any object of perception is combined. This is not only a record of how the object itself is perceived, but, in addition, another part of the self that is invested in it, the same one that gives the object meaning. When an object is mostly a record of reality, it can be called a "real object". When an object is primarily constructed by the self, and thus is a record of self-states formed on the basis of exteroceptive and introceptive data, then it can be called a "self-object" (self-object). Previously, among analytical psychologists (for example, Neumann, 1973) there was an opinion that the child's perception occurs mainly through "objects of the self", that he lives in a kind of mythological world, only gradually building a picture of reality. This is a very misleading description of infancy. However, if a sliding scale is assumed, which covers the changing content of any specific perception (real object - object of the self), in this light it is already possible to make observations. The scheme will take into account projective identification, when the object of the self can either receive information about the real object or avoid it. seems to that in affectively charged states the influence of self-objects increases, while in quiet contemplative inquiry real objects predominate. But such a preliminary conclusion should not allow us to ignore states in which the image is not clearly defined, for example, when an infant's eyes do not immediately focus. Real objects can be perceived in different states, and taking into account the observations during feeding that were mentioned earlier, it can be argued that the perception of "real objects" occurs quite continuously. If we want to get an illustration of the superiority of self-objects, a good example would be the tantrum of an infant, simply put, a situation where a hungry baby will not be breastfed. Instead, blissful states are observed when good self-objects predominate. whereas real objects predominate in quiet contemplative study. But such a preliminary conclusion should not allow us to ignore states in which the image is not clearly defined, for example, when an infant's eyes do not immediately focus.

                                            <h4><em>Good and bad objects</em></h4>
                                            <p>I have described a good object relationship. However, not much time will pass when, for one reason or another, crisis situations will arise. The mother may not have a connection with her child, or vice versa, the baby may lack such an ability, under such conditions a "bad object" appears. Assuming that a bad object is a beta element, there are various ways to deal with it, but first we need to show that the object can be bad in a fairly relative sense:</p>
                                            <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                                            <p>It was said that baby N. was refusing the left breast, but by the time the observer arrived, he was already feeding well on it: what is bad at one moment may be good at another, without noticeable changes in the environment. If the crisis is more acute and too painful, it can be expressed in different ways: crying, whining, screaming, vomiting, defecation, urination, and then the mother is already forced to do something about it.</p>
                                            <p>Baby D was an active and aggressive toddler who could communicate his wishes quite clearly, especially during diaper changes, with loud and boisterous protests. One day, during breastfeeding, a doctor came and needed urgent attention. The mother paused for a short time, placing the baby next to her. He began to shout in protest, "began to clear his throat so that he drowned out all conversations; in addition, he scolded and lied." At first, there was no way to calm him, and the mother was very worried, although in an adequate way: she actively and persistently tried to relieve the child's discomfort. Finally, she reached her goal, and it was possible to continue feeding, and then sleep came. Thus, the potential crisis was resolved properly, so integration took place. Such cases are not isolated at all, and they are a prologue for further interactions.</p>
                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p>But the mother does more than just act: holding the baby in her thoughts, thinking about him, especially in the state of maternal reverie, she directly touches the protomental life of her baby and helps in the transformation of beta elements into alpha elements. It is such interactive experiences that form the basis for an affectively charged mental distinction between good and bad objects, between internal and external. I would suggest that before this distinction is made in the infant, the experiences are repeated many times: disintegration causes reactions of pleasure and displeasure, and this leads to integration and assimilates the distinction in the child's psyche between what is good and what is bad, which is what is inside and what is outside. This is the beginning of the creation of mental structures based on opposites and serving adaptation.</p>
                                            <p>A special case of a bad object is "lack of breasts". This is bad, because in states of hunger it is neither outside nor inside. The baby experiences this as a "bad breast inside" and has to do something&nbsp; <sup>&nbsp;</sup>about this unbearable situation. He can do several things like evacuate it by screaming, defecating, etc. But we can assume that another way is open to him, he can turn it into a thought that can take the form of an image, which actually becomes an important source of mental life - he looks for the "chest" in himself. I will later use this concept as a tool for studying mysticism, however, it is not the best for describing the child's mental states.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Whole and partial objects</em></h4>
                                            <p>The theory of the self that I am putting forward is also relevant to the theory of whole and partial objects. This theory involved the assumption that in the infant's early experience his mother and himself were defined as partial objects. Later, as his perceptual experience expands, he begins to recognize people, and primarily his mother, as a whole. It can be noted that this formulation seems too radical, since it arises in the head of an adult. The judgment may be deepened by the recognition that the infant goes through quite a wide range of experiences during breastfeeding, so that the breast expresses much more than the mere mechanical application of the nipple to the mouth.</p>
                                            <p>The concept of whole and partial objects is useful in evaluating the material that analyzes of children or adults produce when we find that our patients treat the analyst as a partial object. So it can happen that the analyst's communicative manifestations are perceived rather as feeding or penetration, without paying attention to the verbal content of what is being said. This may be explained by the fact that a child cannot know that an object is "partial" until it knows that the object is whole, and this raises the question of what is a whole object for an infant? We cannot know, but the theory of the self that I propose assumes that the whole object appears first, and the partial object later, already as a result of disintegration.</p>
                                            <p>These statements can be used for observation. Good feeding, as already described above (p. 51 <em>),&nbsp;</em> includes a whole range of experiences that go far beyond those centered only around the mouth and nipple. I would assume that this is the infant's relationship through the prism of a holistic object: he, as a whole, deals with the entire mother he knows at that time.</p>
                                            <p>Can partial object relations also be described? I'm sure it is. For example, some babies are much more inclined to pay attention to actually taking the pacifier and much less to the variety of interactions that accompany this action. If the mother colludes in this tendency, partial object feeding becomes apparent.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Example</em></h4>
                                            <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                                            <p>The mother feeds baby L, holding him vertically, away from her body, clumsily twisting him on her legs. With her left hand she held the back of his head, and with her right hand she pushed the bottle. The kid, with wide-open eyes, without blinking, was constantly looking at the picture on the wall.</p>
                                            <p>At the nearly three month visit, L was restless and seemed desperate to have something in his mouth. There was a bit of sour milk coming out of my mouth, so I wiped it off. He seemed to get annoyed and upset, and started crying again. Mother took him, put him to rest and gave him a bottle of rosehip syrup. He intensively sucks the nipple and swallows the drink, turning his head strongly to the side. He drank the whole bottle, but it seems he was not satisfied with it. He fusses and whines. His mother put him in the stroller, put his head on the side and put another bottle of syrup in his mouth. He sucks again vigorously until he eats everything. When the liquid is finished, he turns his face, sucks a little more, stops and falls asleep.</p>
                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p>In order not to conclude that the relationship between L and his mother was formed only on the basis of a "partial object", it should be added that the "whole object" type of relationship was much more evident during bathing and diaper changing.</p>
                                            <p>My opinion does not extend to other aspects of the relationship of the type of partial and whole objects in which, as a result of development through disintegration, the infant comes to distinguish the experience of its mother as good and bad. It is assumed (and there is some evidence for this) that a good mother (breast) and a bad mother (breast) are experienced as two different mothers (breasts). With experience, the baby realizes that these two mothers (breasts) are a single entity. I propose to combine the theory of splitting with the idea of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;the integrity of the object from the very beginning, which is not usually obvious. The subject of the study is quite intricate, so I only want to demonstrate how the theory of the self can lead to an overestimation of observations.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Paranoid-schizoid and depressive position. (Ps ↔ Dp)</em></h4>
                                            <p>Another feature of infancy was first discovered by Melanie Klein. She found that there are two positions that first appear in infancy, the paranoid-schizoid and the depressive positions. These positions are said to persist throughout life. It was she, as well as Harris, who described how they manifest themselves in infancy.</p>
                                            <p>However, based on our observations of infants, they do not appear to be very common in infants at all, although borderline conditions are quite common. I am therefore inclined to provisionally accept Bion's formulas for the sliding scales Ps ↔ Dp, which cover the intermediate states that have been observed.</p>
                                            <p>I am willing to accept these formulations because they correspond to primitive identity (Ps) and the first step of individuation (Dp). I developed this statement in my book&nbsp; <em>"The Self and Autism",&nbsp;</em> so let's not dwell on it. In this book, I do not aim to teach Bion's formula, which is really close to the mental states that can be described at all, I rather look for correlations, expand and make the concept more flexible.</p>
                                            <p>I would like to add here that I also find the concepts of projective and introjective identification very useful along with the development of symbolic alignment and symbol formation.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Studying characteristics in sequence</em></h4>
                                            <p>By studying the characteristics sequentially, it becomes possible to witness the development of the deintegrative action over time and to observe how it enters into a relationship with other, initially discrete patterns of behavior, gradually becoming a characteristic and stable behavior. Baby N. showed a tendency from the very beginning to look away from his mother's face during feeding; instead, his mother noted, he was looking at her jumper, which started in the second week after birth. Later, the jumper and other objects became things not only to be looked at, but also to be picked up or picked up: by three months, he was gathering a handful of fluff between his fingers and putting them in his mouth. Contemplation soon becomes research. Observer's record (when child N. was eight months old): “He found a small crumb on the floor and put it back on the floor, then he picked up a long green thread and put it in his mouth. His mother took it out, N. shouted and hit the table." By nine months, he eats fluff from his mother's jumper and sucks on it, the snoring is followed by vomiting, that is, he removes it from himself, as his mother did to him, but in a different way. Up to 13 months, picking and eating is associated with depression: "He plucks the fluff from his mother's jumper and pulls it into his mouth, the mother removes it, so N. is depressed and clings." Later, in the same observation: "N. is cranky and restless, he pulls threads from his mother's sweater, twisting them around his fingers, and puts them in his mouth; squirms and grunts." Up to 13 months, picking and eating is associated with depression: "He plucks the fluff from his mother's jumper and pulls it into his mouth, the mother removes it, so N. is depressed and clings." Later, in the same observation: "N. is cranky and restless, he pulls threads from his mother's sweater, twisting them around his fingers, and puts them in his mouth; squirms and grunts." Up to 13 months, picking and eating is associated with depression: "He plucks the fluff from his mother's jumper and pulls it into his mouth, the mother removes it, so N. is depressed and clings." Later, in the same observation: "N. is cranky and restless, he pulls threads from his mother's sweater, twisting them around his fingers, and puts them in his mouth; squirms and grunts."</p>
                                            <p>Later, N. developed the behavior of a "collector" - collecting cookies from the table or the floor, searching for and removing garbage from garbage cans, etc. On the other hand, he became more and more attached to the jumper, sometimes reaching up to it to gently rub against its fur with his skin.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Splitting</em></h4>
                                            <p>Using this method, I found it useful to distinguish between disintegration and splitting. The examples I have given so far can be explained by the disintegration hypothesis. However, if the integration process does not proceed as a result, then the term splitting becomes relevant - the child's objects become not only good and bad, but also continuously persecutory.</p>
                                            <p>When N. was about a year old, his mother occasionally scared him that she would go somewhere. Indeed, she suddenly left for a few hours, leaving N. with her husband, who was the guardian at that time. N. was extremely inconsolable! Neither the guardian nor the observer could do anything about it. In the end, in despair from the "haunting" fantasies, he fell asleep sobbing next to a large pale pink elephant that was lying in his crib. This sequence of events happened twice, but the matter did not end there. For several weeks, the baby was suspicious of the observer. Her arrival was apparently associated with the disappearance of her mother. Subsequently, his relationship with his mother, already unstable, deteriorated even more. The pink elephant became more and more important next to the pink jumper, which attracted N.'s attention two weeks after birth.</p>
                                            <p>These events, starting with the mother threatening her disappearance, apparently led to N. projecting his bad objects onto the caregiver and the observer, both of whom became "persecutors." There was no integration and a depressive position, but rather a persecutory depression prevailed, leading to falling asleep, which in this case was not a sign of integration, but on the contrary, was a protective cut-off, a protective splitting. This state of affairs in the future was expressed in the demand for special comfort during falling asleep. He "split off" the consoling mother, replacing her with objects - a pink elephant and a jumper - which thus acquired the character of a fetish, rather than a transitional object.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Representations of the self</em></h4>
                                            <p>In the process of accumulating knowledge about infancy, it increasingly seems as if the "I" of the infant has at its disposal many characteristics that are usually associated with an adult, although it needs to adapt to a completely different environment. This "I" statement is necessary to counteract the tendency to think that the "I" of the infant is quite different from that of the adult. But at the same time, it has the same identity throughout life, only the forms of expression are different, especially in terms of complexity.</p>
                                            <p>We may be surprised at what the infant can do, and what it seems to understand, thanks to the adaptive mechanisms. At the beginning, he does not yet consciously know what is happening, but later, he acquires this knowledge, when the self grows into the "I".</p>
                                            <p>A lot of attention is paid to the child's conscious experience of the "I" of self. It depends on his ability to symbolize and thus transform his experience. That he develops the ability to do this cannot be doubted, and this is reflected in the play and imagination of young children. I have given examples of this in previous posts, including the case of a little two-year-old girl. But it is likely that Symbolization begins to develop much earlier. Klein makes it clear that she believes that such a process should begin in the third or fourth month and reach its peak around the seventh, in the "depressed position." She also intriguingly argues that symbolization underlies the infant's mental life.</p>
                                            <p>Theoretically, there is no difficulty in admitting that archetypal forms are present at birth - they will regulate the behavior of the infant and are postulated to be the potentiality for mental representation. Behind these statements are the ideas of Klein, whose extensive experience and insight have allowed us to increase the credibility of this proposition. We can say that in a certain period of development, the representative forms that stimulate the sense of self are the self that the infant really is, the self that it would like and could be, desired selves and ideal self-images. The child develops feelings of guilt and shame related to what he should be and what he is not. All this helps in organizing a sense of identity.</p>
                                            <p>There are two main factors that make it possible to acquire these mental states, firstly, the development of a sense of time and, secondly, the ability to distinguish oneself among others. This means that he must form a sense of his boundaries, which depends, in turn, on the development of body image.</p>
                                            <p>We cannot yet determine exactly how all this happens, but we can know that the self is already partially represented in the "I". The origins of this idea are in Jung's <em>Mysterium </em><em>&nbsp;Coniunctionis&nbsp;</em> , and to which I referred in Chapter 2 (p. 46).</p>
                                            <p>Since the self is partially represented in the Self, it stands to reason that the rest of the self must be unconscious. This is a significant achievement and involves the formation of self defenses. Bion has a brilliant idea that the division in the infant's consciousness occurs through the formation of a "contact barrier" consisting of a screen of alpha elements.</p>
                                            <p>The evidence, in my view, is based on the study of children with disorders, and these may naturally be exaggerated compared to the norm, so when a pathological element is identified, it may be useful for understanding others. For example, in the book&nbsp; <em>"Self and Autism"&nbsp;</em> I described in detail how a schizoid child developed an imagination that made me think that he lived in another age and could become an alchemist, so complex were the images he created in his manic states. Such a manifestation is not surprising in healthy children's games and fantasies, it is a significant part of the subject of the game, "let's pretend" makes it possible to clearly distinguish it from everyday life. This distinction was beyond my little patient's reach.</p>
                                            <p>Thus, it follows that magical alchemy and mystical insights may have roots in childhood. Later, we will consider these topics in order to present material for comparative reflection.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Conclusion</em></h4>
                                            <p>In this chapter I have applied the theory of the self to the earliest period of life, infancy. In conclusion, I will list how different researchers have developed this topic in different fields.</p>
                                            <ol>
                                            <li>Jung developed a formula to express the structure and dynamics of dreams. This formula follows the sequence I postulated. I illustrated this with the example of a child's dream (Fordham, 1969).</li>
                                            <li>Self theory has been used by many child analysts, and I have applied it to the study of childhood autism.</li>
                                            <li>This went further than explaining the efficacy of infant analysis, for it implied that both infants and children had mental lives distinct from those of their parents.</li>
                                            <li>This led to the study of mothers and infants.</li>
                                            <li>In addition to its use in childhood research, it is used in other areas:&nbsp; <em>(a)</em></li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>In the first chapter, I suggested that&nbsp; <em>active imagination</em> &nbsp;could be understood as based on the disintegration of the self, providing "objective" data to which the subject or his "I" could relate.&nbsp;<em>(b)&nbsp;</em> It was applied to anthropology by John Layard, Rosemary Gordon and Renaldo Maduro.&nbsp;<em>(c)&nbsp;</em> It provided a new criterion of treatment in psychotherapy&nbsp; <em>(see below,&nbsp;</em> pp. Xxff). Integration is not enough; it is desirable to ensure that the patient can disintegrate and go through integrative sequences,&nbsp; <em>(d)&nbsp;</em> ideas were used as a central theme by Kenneth Lambert in his book " <em>Analysis, Repair and Individuation.".</em></p>
                                            <p>From all this, it is clear that the concept of the self, which was first put forward in 1947, was, using Stein's formula, "worked out" and led to the fact that it became less abstract and turned more into a description of mental functioning, which is given meaning. It has also been found to be valuable at different levels of mental functioning and in different age groups.</p>
                                            <h4><em>Notes</em></h4>
                                            <p>Konrad Lorenz describes the work of the VMZ: When we see in natural conditions with what certainty and expediency the VMZ (an innate trigger mechanism) tells the organism which particular modes of behavior contribute to the preservation of the species in the given circumstances, there is a tendency to overestimate the amount of information contained in this message . When we see how ciliates behave "intelligently" near a swarm of feeding bacteria, or how a newly hatched turkey, seeing a bird of prey in flight, huddles into the nearest shelter, or how a young borivitter (a small bird of the falcon family) at its first in contact with water, he bathes and cleans his feathers, as if he had already done this a thousand times, then we learn, almost with disappointment, that primitive infusoria react only to the concentration of acid, that the turkey also hides from a large fly that crawls on a white ceiling ,</p>
                                            <p>"In this way, we have the idea that the libido initially concentrates on one's own self, and later a part of it is transferred to objects, but in fact this transfer of libido to objects is not a final process, and it still refers to the covered them objects in the same way as the body of a small protoplasmic creature is connected with pseudopodia "" 12) (S. Freud, Standard Edition, XIV, p. 76).</p>
