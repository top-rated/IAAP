                      <h4><strong>An introductory word</strong></h4>
                      <p>
                        By "symbolic function" most infant researchers mean the
                        baby's ability to imagine other people or objects in
                        their absence. Thanks to this ability, thinking is
                        detached from concrete perception and opens the way to
                        free fantasy that does not depend on literal reality,
                        and can even deny it. The baby now has the opportunity
                        to imagine and wish for a different reality than the one
                        that is. But until this maturation phase is reached,
                        perception is shifted in the direction of current
                        circumstances, such as affective and cognitive needs,
                        without the possibility of imagining that what is
                        perceived can be different from what it is (see Dornes,
                        1993, p. 193). Transforming ideas about concrete reality
                        into the world of fantasy or imagination is not yet
                        possible for an infant. This exclusively human ability
                        to fantasize, on which our creativity is based and,
                        after all, our entire culture and civilization first
                        unfolds at about 18 months. By this age, "for the
                        infant, his experience has obvious features of
                        inevitability: it cannot be other than what it is"
                        (Ogden, 1984, p. 187). Thus, wishful thinking is
                        impossible for the "pre-symbolic" infant, since wishing
                        is an intrapsychic construct that is itself "constituted
                        by means of a symbolic function." Here, research based
                        on the observation of infants is contrasted with
                        classical Freudian psychoanalysis. since desiring is an
                        intrapsychic construction that is itself "constituted by
                        means of a symbolic function." Here, research based on
                        the observation of infants is contrasted with classical
                        Freudian psychoanalysis. since desiring is an

                      </p>
                      <h4><strong>Cognitive symbols</strong></h4>
                      <p>
                        It should be noted here that by "symbolization" infant
                        researchers mean the image of a memory of an absent
                        object. The caring caretaker, or, as psychoanalysts
                        unpleasantly put it, the "object", becomes a content in
                        the inner world of the imagination, an attainable image
                        that the infant can evoke. This is described as
                        "symbolic representation" and is the premise of any
                        mental image or representation of another or self. It is
                        this ability that usually develops before the age of 18
                        months.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As mentioned earlier, this concept of symbol is not the
                        same as what Jung and analytical psychology understand
                        by symbol; in modern psychoanalysis, symbols also have a
                        more complex meaning. What infant researchers talk about
                        are so-called "cognitive symbols" (see Dornes, 1993, p.
                        184), which represent, in our view, people, things,
                        facts that are momentarily or permanently absent from
                        the external world. However, the presented content is
                        quite familiar and thus corresponds to real perception.
                        It can be called verbally, and we have its image in our
                        head. With the help of verbal definitions, we can convey
                        this meaning to the consciousness of other people. Thus,
                        language largely consists of cognitive symbols.
                      </p>
                      <h4><strong>Psychoanalytic symbols</strong></h4>
                      <p>
                        "Psychoanalytic" symbols, on the contrary, point to what
                        is repressed from consciousness and, therefore,
                        unconscious. The question of whether psychoanalytic
                        symbols in the development of an infant begin to act
                        earlier (at 6-12 months) than cognitive symbols (at 18
                        months) remains open. However, infant researchers are of
                        the opinion that cognitive or semantic symbolism should
                        be seen as a necessary condition for a symbol to be
                        understood psychoanalytically. (see Dornes, 1993, p.
                        105). In addition, the visual representation of
                        repressed content using psychoanalytic symbols implies
                        the existence of internal images. Otherwise, it would be
                        impossible, for example, to symbolize the penis through
                        the image of a snake, or the female genital organs in
                        the form of a vase. Therefore, the existence of
                        cognitive or semantic symbols is, with all probability,
                        a prerequisite for the appearance of psychoanalytic
                        symbols.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But in psychoanalytic theory there is already another
                        version of the concept of symbolization, which serves as
                        an alternative to the concept of repressed content.
                        Guided by the logic of Melanie Klein's previous work on
                        the formation of symbols (Klein, 1930) and Winnicott's
                        theory of the transitional object (1965), comes the
                        understanding of symbolization as the giving of
                        psychological meaning. Symbolization is not absolutely
                        equivalent to graphic expression or representation.
                        Every adult has the ability to express or depict
                        something graphically, but there are many people who
                        cannot "symbolize". Thus, many people suffering from
                        psychosomatic diseases are unable to experience the
                        variety of sensations of their own body, as well as
                        affects, internal images, and thoughts as the ambiguity
                        of their mental life. Feelings and thoughts are for them
                        separate fragments of a fully specified character.
                        Although they ideally able to imagine on the inner
                        screen something that is not physically present, their
                        attempts to fantasize or even feel their own body are
                        empty and stereotyped. The ability to reproduce images
                        in them is preserved, so the experience of vividness,
                        fluidity or meaning associated with any image or affect
                        is rather lost. Therefore, such a person cannot
                        integrate images or affects into a coherent inner world.
                        Thus, this deficiency manifests itself in their
                        inability to give personal meaning to experience, hence
                        to get a chance for any creative path to the
                        imagination. This deficit will be discussed later in
                        connection with issues related to psychotherapy. the

                      <h4><strong>Jungian vision of symbols</strong></h4>
                      <p>
                        With these last observations we come closer to the
                        Jungian view of symbols. Jung distinguishes between the
                        symbol proper and what he calls a sign or allegory.
                        Signs and allegories are referential; that is, point to
                        certain facts that may be generally known and
                        understood. A factual symbol, on the contrary, is for
                        Jung "an optimal designation or formula for a relatively
                        unknown ... fact" (Jung, 1921, p. 814). In contrast to
                        the previous psychoanalytic point of view, Jung is
                        interested here not only in what was repressed, but
                        mainly in the symbol as a form of expression of the
                        unconscious's own creative power. Thus, the symbol
                        stands, so to speak, on the threshold between conscious
                        perceptions or ideas and the influence of processes
                        emanating from the unconscious. As such, he participates
                        in both spheres, combining both conscious and
                        unconscious aspects. So,
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So, it becomes obvious how symbols are an integral part
                        of any religion. They can constellate numinous
                        experiences, giving form or image to an otherwise
                        indescribable, "transcendent" realm. Pointing in the
                        direction of a transcendent dimension, they can evoke a
                        sense of reverent awe in religiously receptive people.
                        Indeed, from a psychological point of view, the realm of
                        the transcendent can mean no more than a dimension that
                        goes beyond human ego-consciousness and is equivalent to
                        the unconscious. Depth psychology recognizes that the
                        power of the unconscious affects our conscious realm and
                        can express itself in symbols of radiant numinousness.
                        As an example, the declaration of the "truth" of any
                        religious belief lies outside the boundaries of
                        psychology. However, beliefs and numinous experiences
                        may be open to psychological investigation. Thus, the
                        symbols that have a numinous character will serve as a
                        means of communication with the transcendental
                        dimension. ("Symbol" comes from the Greek verb
                        "symballein", which in English means literally "to throw
                        together.").
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As mentioned above, for Jung, a symbol, while it is
                        alive, is "an expression of something that cannot be
                        characterized in another or better way." However, a
                        symbol is only alive if:
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        ...it is pregnant with content. But as soon as its
                        meaning is born, as soon as an expression is found that
                        formulates the thing that was sought, expected or
                        heralded better than the hitherto accepted symbol, then
                        the symbol dies, that is, it acquires only a historical
                        meaning. (Jung, 1921, par. 816)
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For this reason, it is absolutely impossible to create a
                        living symbol, that is, one that is pregnant with
                        meaning, only from already known associations. For what
                        is thus formed never contains more than has been put
                        into it” (Jung, 1921, para. 817). However, Jung also
                        acknowledges, and this seems to me to be crucial:
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Whether a thing is a symbol or not depends mainly on the
                        attitude of the observer's consciousness; for example,
                        regarding whether this fact is considered not simply "as
                        such", but also as an expression of something else,
                        something unknown. (Jung, 1921, par. 818)
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Jung expresses all this relatively prosaically, so it
                        appears from his formulation that the above attitude of
                        the observing consciousness and its openness to the
                        symbolic dimension may be the result of a conscious
                        choice. This is understandable, since for Jung, who was
                        homo religiosus by nature, such an attitude was obvious.
                        He was fully convinced of the deep meaning of symbolic
                        language, but often generalized or assumed too much in
                        relation to others. Because of this, many classical
                        Jungians also, time after time, try to convince their
                        analysands of the content and significance of the
                        unconscious and its symbolic language, only dooming
                        themselves to the most counterproductive, didactic style
                        of work. The ability to symbolize creatively cannot be
                        taken for granted because it may be underdeveloped due
                        to conditions of early damage.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Here we are faced with the question: "How does this
                        specifically human capacity for symbolic imagination
                        arise?" In any case, it is an ability inextricably
                        linked to creativity. Although we do not know exactly
                        what is the source of creative fantasy in an individual,
                        it is certainly inconceivable without the ability to
                        symbolize. The fantasy process, of course, requires full
                        cooperation between the so-called cognitive-semantic
                        symbolization and the capacity for symbolic imagination,
                        the latter of which is most clearly postulated in depth
                        psychology. In other words, reality must first of all
                        have an internal representation. It must be presented in
                        such a way that a mental image of it can be evoked at
                        any moment, even when it cannot be perceived directly at
                        the present moment. At the same time, such symbolic and
                        cognitive representations can constantly acquire new
                        meanings. They are pregnant with meaning, as Jung said.
                        For example, the image of the mother is often endowed
                        with great power, so her presence can indicate
                        all-encompassing containment, safety, and protection. Or
                        it can take the form of an intrusive, repulsive or
                        devouring figure. Over time, this imaginary
                        representation of the mother accumulates its own sense
                        of history, shaped by the actual rich interaction of the
                        mother with the child. Thus, "mother" becomes a symbolic
                        image with all the ambiguity of emotional implications
                        and meanings.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Even if the child has not yet developed the ability for
                        symbolic fantasy, there are still his early emotional
                        perceptions, which have merged into various RUVs, which
                        mostly serve as an affective background for further
                        fantasies. It is not easy for Jungians to accept the
                        statement that a person exists in a "pre-symbolic"
                        phase, at least during the first twelve to eighteen
                        months of life. Only with the development of language,
                        which occurs in the second half of the second year, does
                        the ability to symbolic representation appear. According
                        to Lichtenberg, this ability largely serves to build
                        organizational structures designed to cope with the
                        turbulent, conflict-ridden, "demonic" aspects of one's
                        life experience (Lichtenberg, 1983, p. 130). The fact
                        that these aspects of the child's experience (in fact,
                        the experience of the whole life) are later symbolically
                        reflected in dreams, dreams, free associations and
                        spontaneous play, he rightly considers a unique
                        discovery of psychoanalysis. Lichtenberg also emphasizes
                        that traumatic events can be organized in these
                        symbolically represented forms beginning at the
                        eighteenth month (ibid.). Here, Lichtenberg obviously
                        combines a cognitive-semantic concept (language) and a
                        psychoanalytic one.

                      <p>
                        I would like to try to demonstrate how language, which
                        consists of cognitive symbols, is related to symbols in
                        the Jungian sense. Language, as our way of
                        communication, provides a coherent designation of
                        individual objects or facts. There is an assumption that
                        for both partners in communication, this designation
                        evokes a corresponding image; otherwise, the word
                        remains an empty sequence of sounds. The signified and
                        the signified must more or less coincide, both in the
                        mind of the speaker and the listener. With such
                        correspondence, language can become a means of
                        communication and mutual understanding. Since language
                        deals with the signification of concrete objects, where
                        there is a coincidence or correspondence between the
                        signifier and the signified, a communicative exchange
                        takes place. However, the difficulty comes with
                        emotional tones, which are often difficult to put into
                        words and which the other person may not understand. So,
                        language begins to take on a more symbolic or
                        metaphorical character. Someone can say, for example:
                        "I'm in despair." The word "despair" denotes a feeling
                        that can only be understood if you know from experience
                        how exactly it is experienced. And even then, one cannot
                        be sure whether the same nuances are invested by both,
                        or the same level of intensity of the feeling of
                        despair.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In any case, this sentence - "I am in despair" -
                        indicates the corresponding affective state. Perhaps a
                        person is in despair, guesses about the reasons for his
                        condition. Or, instead, despair covers her completely,
                        and leaves no chance of understanding what is happening.
                        Despair often coincides with a sense of impasse. It
                        seems that there is no way out. In such a state, an
                        image of the path may appear, so a person is left with
                        the question of whether to continue walking along it, or
                        to leave this matter behind. Or the path continues
                        endlessly, but there is no strength to go. Should I turn
                        back, hoping to find another way? What should I do? I
                        can't find a way out, I'm desperate. Such images may be
                        associated with feelings of despair, and it is also
                        possible that they will appear similarly in dreams,
                        symbolizing this affective state.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A whole cluster of images can be evoked by the line "I
                        am in despair." For example, I can see myself as a baby
                        who wants to joyfully interact and contact with the
                        mother. But the mother looks away. Perhaps she is
                        sinking into her own despair? She hardly notices my
                        need, she is not present. Today, we are beginning to
                        understand, especially through infant studies, that this
                        may be an example of a chronic deficit in emotional
                        exchange between mother and infant. Thus, the child may
                        feel abandoned and rejected. Babies, when they
                        repeatedly fail to attract their mother's attention,
                        sooner or later become discouraged. They cannot grasp
                        what caused the lack of love: either the mother's
                        limitations (such as her self-doubt or despair) or their
                        own limitations.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Perhaps behind this state of despair there is something
                        else, which remains in most cases deeply unconscious,
                        but is expressed in the well-known collective myth of
                        the Western world. Despair essentially means a feeling
                        of falling out of harmony with God, the world, and
                        oneself. In other words, we are dealing with the myth of
                        paradise lost. In this myth, doubt is caused by the fact
                        that the perfection of the world order created by God is
                        called into question. And of course, it is the serpent
                        with a forked tongue who appears as God's adversary. The
                        snake symbolizes, among other things, the possibility,
                        embedded in human nature, to sow the shadow of such
                        doubt. It poisons the very pleasure of simply existing
                        in harmony with the world and oneself. As such, it
                        represents the deeply rooted human instinct to question
                        again and again the validity of various prohibitions,
                        taboos, postulates of faith and value systems. From the
                        standpoint of the old system of values, the
                        "conservative" internal order, it is a destructive evil.
                        On the other hand, if viewed from within the flow of
                        life, such doubt can also be healing and necessary, and
                        cause a reorientation of a person's entire life.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The feeling of "I'm in despair" ultimately means that
                        I've lost the opportunity to deal fruitfully with my
                        doubts. Not that I have doubts, but that I am completely
                        immersed in doubts. These doubts overwhelm me, they
                        suppress my sense of self-worth and my drive to live. I
                        remain disillusioned with justice and values, they are
                        meaningless and give me no hope. The word "despair"
                        expresses an inner state that is experienced
                        emotionally, and can also be expressed symbolically, for
                        example, with images. When emotions are expressed
                        through images, it is easier to form a conscious
                        attitude to deal with them. In this sense, dreams can be
                        quite valuable.

                        In order to illustrate the meaning of the symbol from a
                        Jungian point of view, I have deliberately not mentioned
                        the famous religious symbols, nor the circle, nor the
                        Buddhist mandala, which played such an important role
                        for Jung as symbols of psychological integrity. I also
                        do not refer to the picture in the literal sense, even
                        though I admit that the idea of
                        &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;a symbol is most often
                        associated with visual images. Instead, I took as a
                        point of departure the phenomenon of descriptive
                        language, accompanied by the question: to what extent
                        does the signification symbolically characterize the
                        signified? And also, to what extent is language capable
                        of covering the entire range of symbolic meanings? As
                        mentioned earlier,

                        looking at disorders, suggest that the capacity for
                        symbolization, which is the basis for fantasy, develops
                        spontaneously according to a maturational schedule. Of
                        course, caring caregivers are expected to facilitate
                        this development as best they can, or at least not to
                        interfere, consciously or unconsciously. Fantasies about
                        the baby play a major role. In any case, the development
                        of the capacity for symbolization depends largely on
                        mirroring and the optimal dose of stimulation from the
                        environment—a topic we explore in more detail in Chapter
                        11.

                        However, it is also worth noting Winnicott's observation
                        that an infant, in the absence of a mother, can
                        experience a piece of blanket, later, a doll or a teddy
                        bear, "as if" they contain a maternal aspect. With good
                        enough mothering, the infant knows how to distinguish
                        between the actual presence of the mother and this "as
                        if" function, which Winnicott called a "transitional
                        object." The transitional function of the symbol is also
                        illustrated by the use of the term "as if" (Gordon,
                        1993). The actual world and the imaginary world are
                        connected - but not merged - thanks to the awareness "as
                        if" the symbolic character of the image is not blurred.
                        It makes sense to assume that productive access to the
                        world of symbols in their "as if" sense is rooted in the
                        infant's undisturbed ability to create and use
                        transitional objects (Winnicott, 1965).
